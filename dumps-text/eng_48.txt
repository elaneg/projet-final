Is lab-grown meat really better for the environment?

   ResearchEnvironment

   Growing meat in the laboratory may not be better for the climate in the
   long run than meat from cattle, according to new research.

   In a first-of-its-kind study from the LEAP (Livestock, Environment and
   People) programme at the Oxford Martin School, the climate-change
   impact of several production methods for lab-grown and farmed beef was
   assessed accounting for the differing greenhouse gases produced. The
   study looked at how much the gases impact temperature rises and how
   long they persist in the atmosphere to understand the warming impact of
   lab-grown and farmed beef. Their new projections reveal that replacing
   cattle with cultured meat may not be a simple replacement of
   high-impact with low-impact. Over the long term, cultured meat
   production methods requiring large energy inputs could increase global
   warming more than some types of cattle farming if energy systems remain
   dependent on fossil fuels. Research on better ways of producing
   cultured meat with less impact is a priority.

   Currently proposed types of lab-grown meat cannot provide a cure-all
   for the detrimental climate impacts of meat production without a
   large-scale transition to a decarbonised energy system, a new study has
   found.

   The study, from the LEAP (Livestock, Environment and People) programme
   at the Oxford Martin School, found that some projections for the uptake
   of particular forms of cultured meat could indeed be better for the
   climate, but others could actually lead to higher global temperatures
   in the long run. Published in Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems,
   their findings highlight that the climate impact of cultured meat
   production will depend on its energy demands and the availability of
   low-carbon energy sources.

   'There has been a great deal of public interest in cultured meat
   recently, and many articles highlight the potential for substituting
   cattle beef with cultured meat to provide an important climate benefit.
   We show that it is not yet clear whether this is the case, partly
   because of uncertainties about how cultured meat would be produced at
   scale. An important issue in comparing farmed and cultured beef is that
   the different warming impacts of greenhouse gases are also not well
   accounted for in the standard measure used in carbon footprints.'
   explains lead author Dr John Lynch.

   Agricultural greenhouse gas emissions are responsible for around a
   quarter of current global warming. Replacing conventional cattle
   farming with ’labriculture’ – meat grown in the lab using cell culture
   techniques – has been widely discussed as a way of reducing this
   environmental impact. But these estimates are based on carbon-dioxide
   equivalent footprints, which can be misleading because not all
   greenhouse gases generate the same amount of warming or have the same
   lifespan.

   'Cattle are very emissions-intensive because they produce a large
   amount of methane from fermentation in their gut,' advises study
   co-author Raymond Pierrehumbert, Halley Professor of Physics at the
   University of Oxford. “Methane is an important greenhouse gas, but the
   way in which we generally describe methane emissions as ‘carbon dioxide
   equivalent’ amounts can be misleading because the two gases are very
   different. Per tonne emitted, methane has a much larger warming impact
   than carbon dioxide, however, it only remains in the atmosphere for
   about 12 years whereas carbon dioxide persists and accumulates for
   millennia. This means methane’s impact on long-term warming is not
   cumulative and is impacted greatly if emissions increase or decrease
   over time.'

   To provide a rigorous comparison of the potential climate impacts of
   lab-grown meat and beef cattle, the researchers examined available data
   on the emissions associated with three current cattle farming methods
   and four possible meat culture methods, assuming current energy systems
   remained unchanged.

   Using this data, they modelled the potential temperature impact of each
   production method over the next 1000 years. Their model showed that
   while cattle initially have a greater warming effect through the
   release of methane, in some cases the manufacture of lab-grown meat can
   ultimately result in more warming. This is due to the fact that even if
   consumption of meat were entirely phased out the warming from carbon
   dioxide would persist, whereas warming caused by methane ceases after
   only a few decades.

   'This is important because while reducing methane emissions would be
   good – and an important part of our climate policies – if we simply
   replace that methane with carbon dioxide it could actually have
   detrimental long-term consequences,' warns Lynch.

   Beef production is currently a major source of greenhouse gases:
   reducing consumption and improving production methods to reduce
   emissions can both help address this. The environmental benefits of
   lab-grown meat are a powerful imperative to continue and expand
   labriculture research, and especially to develop ways of producing
   cultured meat as efficiently as possible. The study also highlights
   that both cultured meat and cattle farming have complex inputs and
   impacts that need to be considered in fully appreciating their effect
   on the environment. For example, creating more grazing land for cattle
   often results in significant deforestation that could greatly increase
   the CO2 footprint of cattle systems (but can prove difficult to
   standardise in emissions footprints), while producing food in urban
   laboratories could free up land for storing CO2 (known as carbon
   sequestration) or other purposes.

   Lynch concludes, 'The climate impacts of cultured meat production will
   depend on what level of sustainable energy generation can be achieved,
   as well as the efficiency of future culture processes.'
