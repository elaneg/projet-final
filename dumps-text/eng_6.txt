   A man and a woman in a health club

   Fitness culture is a sociocultural phenomenon surrounding exercise and
   physical fitness.^[1] It is usually associated with gym culture, as
   doing physical exercises in locations such as gyms, wellness centres
   and health clubs is a popular activity. An international survey found
   that more than 27% of the world's total adult population attends
   fitness centres, and that 61% of regular exercisers are currently doing
   "gym-type" activities.^[2] Getting and maintaining physical fitness has
   been shown to benefit individuals' inner and outer health. Fitness
   culture has been highly promoted through modern technology and social
   media platforms.^[3]

Development

   [edit]

Gymnastics of ancient Greece and Rome

   [edit]

   The word gymnastics is derived from the Greek word gymnazein which
   literally means "to exercise naked".^[4] In ancient Greece and Rome, a
   public place devoted to athletes training, called gymnasion (plural:
   gymnasia) for Greeks and palaestra (plural: palaestrae) for Romans
   existed in cities. Fitness was regarded as a concept shaped by two
   cultural codes: rationalization and asceticism; authenticity and
   hedonism, respectively. In Greece, gymnastic excellence was regarded as
   a noble and godly pursuit and was included in a complete education.
   Gymnasiums became the center of the community, being associated with
   the arts, the study of logic, and a source of entertainment. Skilled
   athletes attained an elevated status and devoted their lives to
   becoming proficient in exercise.^[5] Both men and women participated in
   various gymnastic exercises. The series of activities included
   swimming, throwing, wrestling, jumping and weightlifting.^[4] After the
   Romans conquered Greece, they developed the activities into a more
   formal sport and used their gymnasiums to prepare their legions for
   warfare. However, with the decline of the Roman Empire, people lost
   their interest in gymnastics, and it is now only known as a form of
   entertainment.

Nineteenth century

   [edit]

   From around 1800, gymnastics developed in Western countries that was
   meant to enhance the body in order to sustain public morals and mold
   better citizens.^[6] Pehr Henrik Ling was a pioneer in the teaching of
   physical education in Sweden, and he sought to reform and improve the
   gymnastics of the ancient Greeks. In 1850, the Supreme Medical Board of
   Russia reported to their emperor on Ling's system, that by improving
   one's overall fitness, an athlete became superior to those who merely
   focused on a subset of muscles or actions.^[5] In the mid-19th century,
   the world saw the rise of physical culture, a movement that emphasized
   the importance of physical exercise for men, women, and children alike.
   Diocletian Lewis, a physician, even advocated for males and females
   exercising together in the gym.^[7] In 1896 Men's gymnastics was on the
   schedule of the first modern Olympics. The Olympic gymnastic
   competition for women began in 1928.^[4]

World War II

   [edit]

   Leading up to and during World War II, totalitarian regimes used
   gymnastics as a way to promote their ideologies.^[6] Physical fitness
   was at the core of Nazi philosophy, and the German government financed
   the construction of sports and wellness facilities. In 1922, the Nazi
   Party established the Hitler Youth, where children and adolescents
   participated in physical activities to develop both their physical and
   mental fitness.^[8] Nazi sports imagery served the purpose of promoting
   the idea of "Aryan" racial superiority, and in 1933, an "Aryans only"
   policy was instituted in all German athletic organizations.^[9]

   In the Soviet Union, the Leninist Young Communist League created the
   Ready for Labour and Defence of the USSR in 1931, which was a fitness
   program that was designed to improve public health and prepare the
   population for highly productive work and the defense of "the
   motherland".^[10]

The Cold War

   [edit]

   During the Cold War, a focus on physical fitness emerged in both the
   United States and the Soviet Union. Senator Hubert Humphrey gravely
   warned that communist dominance came from superior sports and fitness
   programs. His remarks reflected the growing American paranoia of
   communism. In response, leaders of the military, civilian government,
   and private sector began crafting a "cult and ritual of
   toughness".^[11] President John F. Kennedy issued a call to the nation
   urging Americans to prioritize their physical fitness across the
   country. Fitness was clearly described as a "matter of achieving an
   optimum state of well-being" that required exercise from both young and
   old.^[12] This focus on fitness also opened the doors for female
   athletes in both the U.S. and the USSR to become more prominent as
   contenders in the Olympics.^[13]

Mass participation, commercialization

   [edit]

   After World War II, a new form of non-organized, individualistic,
   health-oriented physical and recreational activities such as jogging
   began to prevail.^[6] The Royal Canadian Air Force Exercise Plans,
   developed by Dr Bill Orban in 1961, sold 23 million copies to the
   public. United States Air Force Colonel Kenneth Cooper's book Aerobics
   was released in 1968 and the mass-market version The New Aerobics in
   1979. These publications by Orban and Cooper helped to launch modern
   fitness culture.^[14]^[15]^[16]^[17] The Olympics inspired a running
   boom in the 1970s.^[18] After the release of Jane Fonda's Workout
   exercise videos in 1982, aerobics became a popular form of group
   gymnastic activity.

   Fitness began to be commercialised. Gyms were set up with the goals not
   to improve public health but to stimulate and exploit the desire of
   people to keep fit, have fun and improve themselves. It can also be
   observed in today's gyms where bodybuilders are trying to reach their
   aesthetic ideas, through muscle development, using weights and other
   equipment. Growth in bodybuilding as a fitness phenomenon followed the
   movie and book Pumping Iron in 1977 and the movie Pumping Iron II in
   1985.^[6]^[19]^[20]

   The term gym is often associated with the term fitness, and going to
   gyms means doing exercises in fitness institutions such as fitness
   centres, health clubs or gym clubs where people have to pay for
   membership in order to use fitness equipment and participate in group
   fitness activities with instructors, such as aerobics and yoga
   classes.^[6]^[19]^[20]

Technology, specialization, branding

   [edit]

   Advances in technology in the twenty-first century have changed the way
   of doing fitness activities. The Quantified Self has become a new
   phenomenon, where people use the help of technological devices to
   support their workouts. It is characterized by the use of gadgets such
   as pedometer, GPS, heart rate monitor and smartphone apps to quantify
   or monitor the exerciser's efforts.^[21]

   There was a decrease in popularity of "pure aerobics" exercise and an
   increase in "socially based exercise".^[22]^[23] Participation moved
   from aerobics, bodybuilding, and traditional technique of exercises to
   activities such as yoga, zumba, pilates, spinning and aquacycling, tai
   chi, kickboxing, and outdoor fitness.^[24]^[25]^[26]

   Exercises have been commercialized as branded exercises by fitness
   institutions. Branded exercises are group workouts developed by fitness
   institutions for people with different goals of fitness.^[citation
   needed]

Influences

   [edit]
   Further information: Social influences on fitness behavior

Mass media

   [edit]

   Mass media shapes fitness culture by conveying an ideal body image,
   often promoting slimness or even thinness for females and slenderness
   or muscularity for males.^[27] Commercial advertisements have also
   created an influential and powerful force in promoting a stereotype of
   ideal body image which is not limited to fashion advertisements.^[28]

   Exercising and dieting are often seen as the best way to achieve such
   an ideal body image.^[22] Fashion magazines promote slimness and
   thinness as the ideal female image. High-fashion models are usually
   slim and thin. In addition, the shape of models has changed
   dramatically^[when?] towards a “more tubular female form” in high
   fashion culture,^[28] often sparking controversies.^[29]

   Fitness-related content on social media, such as Facebook or Instagram,
   can be called fitspiration. When women view fitness content, they tend
   to develop a more negative body image and are quicker to compare their
   bodies to the ones they are seeing on social media.^[30] Men are
   subject to this as well; however, this phenomenon is less common among
   men.^[citation needed]

   The rise of fitness influencers on social media sets unrealistic
   expectations that people feel pressured to keep up with. This has
   caused people to focus on achieving someone else's body type rather
   than their own overall health and
   well-being.^[31]^[better source needed] Social media has made the
   fitness community grow, however, it is important to remember that not
   everything seen online is real.

Peer influence

   [edit]

   People who regularly attend fitness institutions tend to make friends
   at these locations. They want to feel part of a group, which can be
   referred to as community feeling, as the behavior of group membership
   is transmitted from member to member within a group. However, this kind
   of friendship usually remains restricted within the fitness
   institution.^[32] Besides, the atmosphere in fitness institutions
   created by people with the same goal becomes a force of motivation.
   When people go to fitness institutions or start a new activity, they
   can be encouraged by others and give support to each other.^[22]

   In addition, fitness institutions can function as dating agencies,
   creating chances to meet people apart from workplaces. Music, body
   movement, and costumes of people exercising can easily draw attention
   and become an occasion to engage with each other.^[33]

   Another important aspect of fitness culture is the gender
   differentiation in exercises performed. One study showed that women
   prefer to do cardiovascular exercise over weight training because it
   allows them to gain strength without transgressing norms for feminine
   physical appearance, whereas men prefer other exercises like
   bodybuilding or boxing in order to be more muscular.^[33]

Personal trainers

   [edit]
   Main article: Personal trainer

   Fitness institutions have been developed as a commercial environment
   since the 1980s.^[6]^[33] Personal trainers act as intermediaries
   between customers and the fitness institution, playing a crucial role
   in the commercialization of fitness culture.^[34]

   The popularity of personal trainers can be explained by the human
   tendency toward rule-governed behavior.^[35] The role of personal
   trainers has also revealed a phenomenon which can be explained from the
   sociological perspective of "outsourced-self".^[36] This means
   "transferring our own responsibility to other".^[34] Keeping healthy
   and well are people's own responsibility; however, people are hiring
   personal trainers to be responsible for it. It is also relevant to the
   perspective of "body work" in the sociology of body: people are
   outsourcing their own bodies to paid workers in order to keep healthy
   and prevent illness.^[37]

Fitness fashion

   [edit]
   Further information: Sportswear and Athleisure

   Fitness fashion is a product created by the commercialization of
   fitness culture. As mentioned above, personal trainers also act as
   agents to sell different goods and services. An example is the case of
   Body Training System (BTS). BTS instructors are suggested to change
   their costumes according to the programs in order to show the
   differences in character. The aim is to inspire the trainees to
   purchase the same costumes offered by the programs.^[38]

   Fitness fashion and athletic footwear have become the fastest-growing
   segments in the apparel market. The athleisure trend frames it not only
   for sports activities but also as daywear or weekend wear. While
   classic sports brands continue to expand their market share in the
   industry, high fashion brands have also joined the competition.^[39]
