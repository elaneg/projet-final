   The Plaquemine culture was an archaeological culture (circa 1200 to
   1700 CE) centered on the Lower Mississippi River valley.^[1] It had a
   deep history in the area stretching back through the earlier Coles
   Creek (700–1200 CE) and Troyville cultures (400–700 CE)^[2] to the
   Marksville culture (100 BCE to 400 CE).^[3] The Natchez and related
   Taensa peoples were their historic period descendants.^[4] The type
   site for the culture is the Medora site in Louisiana; while other
   examples include the Anna, Emerald, Holly Bluff, and Winterville sites
   in Mississippi.^[5]

Definition

   [edit]

   The Plaquemine culture was a Mississippian culture variant centered on
   the Mississippi River valley, stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to
   just south of its junction with the Arkansas River, encompassing the
   Yazoo River basin and Natchez Bluffs in western Mississippi, and the
   lower Ouachita and Red River valleys in southeastern Arkansas, and
   eastern Louisiana.^[1] They were primarily agriculturists who grew
   maize, pumpkins, squash, beans and tobacco but they also hunted,
   fished, and gathered wild plants.^[6]^[3]^[7]

   The Medora site in West Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana is the type site
   for the period, defined by Dr. James A. Ford and George I. Quimby after
   excavations at the site in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The name for
   the culture is taken from the proximity of Medora to the nearby town of
   Plaquemine. It was inhabited from approximately 1300 to 1600 CE and it
   consisted of two platform mounds separated by a plaza. Pottery from the
   site was overwhelmingly grog-tempered with only a few bits of
   shell-tempered pottery being found. These cultural hallmarks along with
   the implementation of intensive maize agriculture have become
   Plaquemine culture designators.^[8]^[9]

   Plaquemine was an outgrowth of the earlier Coles Creek culture (700 to
   1200 CE). They experienced significant contact with Mississippian
   culture peoples to their north and east and the Terminal Coles
   Creek/early Plaquemine period was contemporaneous with the height of
   the Middle Mississippian culture at Cahokia in the American Bottom near
   St. Louis, Missouri. After Cahokia's collapse in the mid 14th century
   they coexisted with Late Mississippian groups centered on eastern
   Arkansas near Memphis. Archaeologists debate whether Plaquemine is a
   completely local development or if the changes in their society that
   led from Coles Creek to Plaquemine was a result of contact with their
   Mississippian neighbors. Many of these Coles Creek sites continued use
   by their Plaquemine descendants, and Plaquemine sites were still being
   used in the early 1700s during the early historic
   period.^[1]^[2]^[3]^[4]

   The Plaquemine period saw the re-purposing and expansion of sites
   occupied during the Coles Creek period. Unlike Mississippian
   settlements which were often large nucleated villages, Plaquemine
   settlements were usually barely populated ceremonial civic centers
   whose only permanent residents were the elites and their families,
   priests, and their attendants and servants. Everyone else lived in
   small hamlets and farmsteads dispersed across the landscape. Coupled
   with the adoption of maize agriculture during this period was a
   population explosion and an increase in the number and size of the
   sites. The ethnographic record from the historic period suggests some
   large sites such as Winterville or Emerald were the centers of
   paramount chiefdoms who exerted control over other smaller civic sites.
   These second tier rulers, part of a hereditary nobility, would have
   been related matrilineally to the ruling paramount chief. An inherently
   volatile system, sometimes factions in smaller centers attained
   supremacy and power would shift from one civic center to another,
   resulting in the partial or total abandonment of the former
   capital.^[7]

Plaquemine Mississippian

   [edit]
   [330px-Gulf_Coast_Shell_Tempered_Ceramics_HRoe_2012.jpg] Spread of
   shell tempered pottery eastward into southern Plaquemine area

   Beginning during the Terminal Coles Creek period (1150 to 1250 CE),
   Mississippian cultures far upstream from the Plaquemine area began
   expanding their reach southward. Excavations in the Yazoo Basin area of
   Mississippi have shown a Cahokia Horizon as extra-regional exotic
   goods, such as Cahokian pottery and other artifacts, began to be
   deposited in Coles Creek-Plaquemine culture sites.^[10] Through
   repeated contacts, groups in Mississippi and then Louisiana began
   adopting Mississippian techniques for making pottery, as well as
   ceremonial objects and possibly social structuring.^[11]

   By the mid 15th century influences from Pensacola culture peoples (from
   the Bottle Creek site on the Gulf Coast near Mobile) had begun
   spreading westward across Barataria Bay and the Atchafalaya Basin and
   by 1700 had Mississipianized the local populations as far north as
   modern day Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Use of grog tempering for pottery at
   locations such as the Sims site in southeastern Louisiana had been
   replaced by shell tempering.^[12]^[13]^[14]

   The Plaquemine peoples absorbed more Mississippian influence and the
   area of their distinct culture began to shrink after 1350 CE.
   Eventually the last enclave of purely Plaquemine culture was the
   southern Natchez Bluffs area, while the Yazoo Basin and Louisiana areas
   became a hybrid Plaquemine Mississippian culture.^[15]

Protohistory

   [edit]
   [330px-DeSoto_Map_HRoe_2008.jpg] A map showing the de Soto route
   through the Southeast[250px-Winterville_Aerial_View_HRoe_2016.jpg]
   Winterville site, near Greenville, Mississippi

   The earliest European account of the culture may be recorded in the
   journals of the Spanish expedition of Hernando de Soto. In 1542 de
   Soto's expedition encountered a powerful chiefdom located on the
   eastern bank of the Mississippi River. Native sources called it
   "Quigualtam", the name of the polity, its capital, and its paramount
   chief. By this point the expedition had been traversing the southeast
   for several years and accounts of their deplorable treatment of the
   indigenous populations would have been known by groups they had yet to
   contact in person. Their encounter with the polity was brief and
   violent; the natives attacked and chased the Spaniards with their
   canoes. When the remnants of de Sotos expedition finally made it down
   the river past Quigualtam they encountered below it another unnamed but
   powerful chiefdom; who also gave chase until the foreigners had left
   their territory.^[16]

   Various scholars have debated the identities of these two groups and
   their exact locations. Historian Charles M. Hudson has suggested that
   Quigualtam was centered on the area surrounding the Holly Bluff or
   Winterville sites in the lower Yazoo Basin. The sites themselves are
   thought by archaeologists to have been abandoned by this point but the
   power center of the polity had probably shifted to another site within
   its territory.^[16] Others have put forward the Glass site; which is on
   the flood plain in between the Mississippi River and the Natchez Bluffs
   approximately 9.5 kilometres (5.9 mi) south of Vicksburg.^[7] A
   possibility for the second group is the Emerald Phase (1500 – 1680) of
   the Natchez chiefdom, headquartered at the massive Emerald Mound; which
   was in its ascendancy at the time. These two sites were the only major
   ceremonial center on this stretch of the Mississippi River occupied
   during the protohistoric period from 1500 to 1650 CE.^[16]^[7] Since
   the Spaniards never made it ashore to leave archaeological evidence of
   contact with these two groups their exact identity will probably never
   be determined with certainty. No further recorded European contact with
   the indigenous people in this area occurred for almost 140 years when
   the first French explorers arrived in the area. By the historic period,
   power had shifted within the Natchez polity from Emerald Mound to the
   Grand Village of the Natchez.^[17]^[18]^[19]^[20]

   In the meantime native peoples of the region suffered from epidemics of
   infectious disease; carried both by the de Soto expedition and
   indirectly from other Native Americans who had contact with European
   traders on the Gulf coast. On top of this the intrusion of Europeans
   had upset the delicate political balance between native groups who had
   existed in a state of endemic warfare between polities for generations.
   Many societies in the region began to collapse. Remnant populations of
   Mississippian peoples began migrating across and down the
   Mississippi.^[21]^[17]^[18]^[19]^[20] The post de Soto entrada
   Transylvania Phase (1550-1700 CE) of the Tensas Basin saw the
   increasing spread of Mississippian influences diffusing southward from
   Arkansas and northwestern Mississippi into traditional Plaquemine
   territory.^[22] The Jordan Mounds site on a relict channel of the
   Arkansas River in northeastern Louisianas Morehouse Parish was
   constructed during the protohistoric period between 1540 and 1685. The
   builders were an intrusive group in the area; Mississippianized peoples
   who were possibly refugees from the Mississippi River area to the east
   that were escaping the collapse of their societies brought about by the
   aftereffects of first European contact.^[23] Others, such as the
   multiple Mississippian Tunica speaking polities encountered by de Soto
   in Arkansas and northwestern Mississippi had all but vanished; with a
   few small groups like the Tunica and Koroa relocating to former
   Plaquemine territory at the mouth of the Yazoo River in west central
   Mississippi. The Central Mississippi Valley which de Soto had described
   as the most heavily populated area he had seen since the Valley of
   Mexico was now almost vacant; only sparsely occupied by the Quapaw who
   were an intrusive Dhegiha Siouan people that moved into the area from
   the Ohio River region sometime in the late 16th to early 17th
   century.^[21]

Historic era

   [edit]
   Main articles: Taensa and Natchez people

   Now surrounded on all sides by Mississippians, several Plaquemine
   groups persisted into the historic era in the Natchez Bluffs area.
   Cultural trappings including societal organization, language and
   pottery styles in Louisiana and Mississippi during the early historic
   period bear this out. Possibly because their encounter with de Soto had
   been so brief compared to the more northerly populations, the
   Plaquemine Natchez people and Taensa peoples alone maintained the
   characteristics of complex chiefdoms such as hereditary elites, mound
   ceremonialism, and retainer sacrifice long into the period after the
   European colonization of America began. They were the last Plaquemine
   culture peoples.^[3]^[4] Groups who were intrusive to the area or local
   groups who had been Mississippianized are identified at the time of
   sustained European contact as those tribes speaking the Tunican,
   Chitimachan, and Muskogean languages.^[11]

Culture

   [edit]

Architecture

   [edit]

   They had complex political and religious institutions and lived in
   villages centered on large ceremonial centers with two or more platform
   mounds facing an open plaza. The site of a mound was usually one with
   special significance, either a pre-existing mortuary site, temple, or
   civic structure. The flat-topped, pyramidal mounds usually underwent
   multiple episodes of mound construction and were built in several
   stages. Sometimes they were topped by one or more smaller mounds
   secondary mounds. After each expansion episode new structures were
   usually constructed on their summits.^[24] In earlier times, buildings
   were usually circular, but later they were likely to be rectangular.
   They were constructed of wattle and daub, and sometimes with wall posts
   sunk into wall trenches. At times, shallow, oval or rectangular graves
   were dug in the mounds. These might have been for primary burials, but
   more often they were for the reburial of remains originally interred in
   mortuary houses.^[24]

   This pattern of plazas flanked by mounds with temples, elite residences
   and mortuary structures at their summits was inherited from their
   Troyville and Coles Creek culture ancestors, and was a village
   arrangement widely employed throughout the southeast.^[3] Like other
   Native Americans in the southeast this open plaza area would have been
   used for public rituals and functions such as the Green Corn Ceremony
   and games such as chunkey and the ballgame.^[25]^[26]

Ceramics

   pottery

   Plaquemine pottery was decorated with their own unique characteristics.
   They sometimes added small solid handles called lugs and textured the
   surface by brushing clumps of grass over the vessel before it was
   fired. Potters cut designs into the surface of the wet clay and, like
   their Caddoan contemporaries, the Plaquemine peoples engraved designs
   on pots after they were fired. Plaquemine peoples also had undecorated
   pots that they used for ordinary daily tasks. Pottery was included in
   burials as grave goods, often being ritually "killed". This type has a
   hole in the base of the vessel that was cut while the pot was being
   made, usually before it was fired.^[24]

   Pottery during this phase still used grog tempering as their Coles
   Creek ancestors had; with the use of ground mussel shell tempering
   being a distinctive marker for Mississippian cultural contact.^[27]
   Pottery from protohistoric Natchez sites in western Mississippi still
   used the traditional Plaquemine grog tempering and traditional vessel
   forms. The pottery of the Taensa in eastern Louisiana used
   Mississippian style shell tempering and pottery shapes but was still
   being engraved with decorative designs typical of the Plaquemine area.
   This difference between the two closely related groups showed that
   Mississippian diffusion into the area beginning during the Transylvania
   Phase (1550-1700 CE) of the Tensas Basin region from what is now
   southeastern Arkansas had by the late 17th century reached the lower
   Tensas River basin in Louisiana.^[28]
