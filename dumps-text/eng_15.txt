   Medical diagnostic method
                       Throat culture
   [250px-Throat_Culture.png]
   Purpose Diagnose bacteria or fungal infection in throat

   A throat culture is a laboratory diagnostic test that evaluates for the
   presence of a bacterial or fungal infection in the throat. A sample
   from the throat is collected by swabbing the throat and placing the
   sample into a special cup (culture) that allows infections to grow. If
   an organism grows, the culture is positive and the presence of an
   infection is confirmed. The type of infection is found using a
   microscope, chemical tests, or both. If no infection grows, the culture
   is negative. Common infectious organisms tested for by a throat culture
   include Candida albicans, known for causing thrush, and Group A
   streptococcus, known for causing strep throat,^[1] scarlet fever, and
   rheumatic fever.^[1] Throat cultures are more sensitive (81% sensitive)
   than the rapid strep test (70%) for diagnosing strep throat, but are
   nearly equal in terms of specificity.^[1]

Purpose

   [edit]

   A throat culture may be done to investigate the cause of a sore throat.
   Most sore throats are caused by viral infections. However, in some
   cases the cause of a sore throat may be unclear and a throat culture
   can be used to determine if the infection is bacterial. Identifying the
   responsible organism can guide treatment.

Technique

   [edit]

   The person receiving the throat culture is asked to tilt his or her
   head back and open his or her mouth. The health professional will press
   the tongue down with a tongue depressor and examine the mouth and
   throat. A clean swab will be rubbed over the back of the throat, around
   the tonsils, and over any red areas or sores to collect a sample.

   The sample may also be collected using a throat washout. For this test,
   the patient will gargle a small amount of salt water and then spit the
   fluid into a clean cup. This method gives a larger sample than a throat
   swab and may make the culture more reliable.

   A culture for Streptococcus pyogenes can take 18–24 hours when grown at
   37 degrees Celsius (body temperature).^[1]
