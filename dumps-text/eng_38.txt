   The British Museum is a public museum dedicated to human history, art
   and culture located in the Bloomsbury area of London. Its permanent
   collection of eight million works is the largest in the world.^[3] It
   documents the story of human culture from its beginnings to the
   present.^[a] Established in 1753, the British Museum was the first
   public national museum.^[4] In 2023, the museum received 5,820,860
   visitors and was the most visited attraction in the United Kingdom.^[2]

   At its beginning, the museum was largely based on the collections of
   the Anglo-Irish physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane.^[5] It opened
   to the public in 1759, in Montagu House, on the site of the current
   building. The museum's expansion over the following 250 years was
   largely a result of British colonisation and resulted in the creation
   of several branch institutions, or independent spin-offs, the first
   being the Natural History Museum in 1881. Some of its best-known
   acquisitions, such as the Greek Elgin Marbles and the Egyptian Rosetta
   Stone, are subject to long-term disputes and repatriation
   claims.^[6]^[7]

   In 1973, the British Library Act 1972^[8] detached the library
   department from the British Museum, but it continued to host the now
   separated British Library in the same Reading Room and building as the
   museum until 1997. The museum is a non-departmental public body
   sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Like all UK
   national museums, it charges no admission fee except for loan
   exhibitions.^[9]

History

   [edit]

Sir Hans Sloane

   [edit]
   [250px-Sir_Hans_Sloane%2C_an_engraving_from_a_portrait_by_T._Murray.jpg
   ] Sir Hans Sloane

   Although today principally a museum of cultural art objects and
   antiquities, the British Museum was founded as a "universal museum".
   Its foundations lie in the will of the Anglo-Irish physician and
   naturalist Sir Hans Sloane (1660–1753), a London-based doctor and
   scientist from Ulster. During the course of his lifetime, and
   particularly after he married the widow of a wealthy Jamaican
   planter,^[10] Sloane gathered a large collection of curiosities, not
   wishing to see his collection broken up after death, he bequeathed it
   to King George II, for the nation, for a sum of £20,000 (equivalent to
   £3,846,793 in 2023) to be paid to his heirs by
   Parliament^[11]—intentionally far less than the estimated value of the
   artefacts, contemporarily estimated at £50,000 (equivalent to
   £9,616,983 in 2023) or more according to some sources, and up to
   £80,000 (equivalent to £15,387,173 in 2023) or more by
   others.^[12]^[13]

   At that time, Sloane's collection consisted of around 71,000 objects of
   all kinds^[14] including some 40,000 printed books, 7,000 manuscripts,
   extensive natural history specimens including 337 volumes of dried
   plants, prints and drawings including those by Albrecht Dürer and
   antiquities from Sudan, Egypt, Greece, Rome, the Ancient Near and Far
   East and the Americas.^[15]

Foundation (1753)

   [edit]

   On 7 June 1753, King George II gave his royal assent to the Act of
   Parliament which established the British Museum.^[b] The British Museum
   Act 1753 also added two other libraries to the Sloane collection,
   namely the Cottonian Library, assembled by Sir Robert Cotton, dating
   back to Elizabethan times, and the Harleian Library, the collection of
   Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer. They were joined in
   1757 by the "Old Royal Library", now the Royal manuscripts, assembled
   by various British monarchs. Together these four "foundation
   collections" included many of the most treasured books now in the
   British Library^[17] including the Lindisfarne Gospels and the sole
   surviving manuscript of Beowulf.^[c]

   The British Museum was the first of a new kind of museum – national,
   belonging to neither church nor king, freely open to the public and
   aiming to collect everything. Sloane's collection, while including a
   vast miscellany of objects, tended to reflect his scientific
   interests.^[18] The addition of the Cotton and Harley manuscripts
   introduced a literary and antiquarian element, and meant that the
   British Museum now became both National Museum and library.^[19]

Cabinet of curiosities (1753–1778)

   [edit]
   [250px-The_North_Prospect_of_Mountague_House_JamesSimonc1715.jpg]
   Montagu House, c. 1715

   The body of trustees decided on a converted 17th-century mansion,
   Montagu House, as a location for the museum, which it bought from the
   Montagu family for £20,000. The trustees rejected Buckingham House,
   which was later converted into the present day Buckingham Palace, on
   the grounds of cost and the unsuitability of its location.^[20]^[d]

   With the acquisition of Montagu House, the first exhibition galleries
   and reading room for scholars opened on 15 January 1759.^[21] At this
   time, the largest parts of collection were the library, which took up
   the majority of the rooms on the ground floor and the natural history
   objects, which took up an entire wing on the first floor. In 1763, the
   trustees of the British Museum, under the influence of Peter Collinson
   and William Watson, employed the former student of Carl Linnaeus,
   Daniel Solander, to reclassify the natural history collection according
   to the Linnaean system, thereby making the museum a public centre of
   learning accessible to the full range of European natural
   historians.^[22] In 1823, George IV gave the King's Library assembled
   by George III,^[23] and Parliament gave the right to a copy of every
   book published in the country, thereby ensuring that the museum's
   library would expand indefinitely. During the few years after its
   foundation the British Museum received several further gifts, including
   the Thomason Collection of Civil War Tracts and David Garrick's library
   of 1,000 printed plays. The predominance of natural history, books and
   manuscripts began to lessen when in 1772 the museum acquired for £8,410
   its first significant antiquities in Sir William Hamilton's "first"
   collection of Greek vases.^[24]

Indolence and energy (1778–1800)

   [edit]
   [250px-Entrance_ticket_to_the_British_Museum%2C_London_March_3%2C_1790.

   From 1778, a display of objects from the South Seas brought back from
   the round-the-world voyages of Captain James Cook and the travels of
   other explorers fascinated visitors with a glimpse of previously
   unknown lands. The bequest of a collection of books, engraved gems,
   coins, prints and drawings by Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode in 1800 did
   much to raise the museum's reputation; but Montagu House became
   increasingly crowded and decrepit and it was apparent that it would be
   unable to cope with further expansion.^[25]

   The museum's first notable addition towards its collection of
   antiquities, since its foundation, was by Sir William Hamilton
   (1730–1803), British Ambassador to Naples, who sold his collection of
   Greek and Roman artefacts to the museum in 1784 together with a number
   of other antiquities and natural history specimens. A list of donations
   to the museum, dated 31 January 1784, refers to the Hamilton bequest of
   a "Colossal Foot of an Apollo in Marble". It was one of two antiquities
   of Hamilton's collection drawn for him by Francesco Progenie, a pupil
   of Pietro Fabris, who also contributed a number of drawings of Mount
   Vesuvius sent by Hamilton to the Royal Society in London.

Growth and change (1800–1825)

   [edit]
   [250px-Rosetta_Stone_International_Congress_of_Orientalists_ILN_1874.jp
   g] The Rosetta Stone on display in the British Museum in 1874

   In the early 19th century the foundations for the extensive collection
   of sculpture began to be laid and Greek, Roman and Egyptian artefacts
   dominated the antiquities displays. After the defeat of the French
   campaign in the Battle of the Nile, in 1801, the British Museum
   acquired more Egyptian sculptures and in 1802 King George III presented
   the Rosetta Stone – key to the deciphering of hieroglyphs.^[26] Gifts
   and purchases from Henry Salt, British consul general in Egypt,
   beginning with the Colossal bust of Ramesses II in 1818, laid the
   foundations of the collection of Egyptian Monumental Sculpture.^[27]
   Many Greek sculptures followed, notably the first purpose-built
   exhibition space, the Charles Towneley collection, much of it Roman
   sculpture, in 1805. In 1806, Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin,
   ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1799 to 1803 removed the large
   collection of marble sculptures from the Parthenon, on the Acropolis of
   Athens and transferred them to the UK. In 1816 these masterpieces of
   western art were acquired by the British Museum by Act of Parliament
   and deposited in the museum thereafter.^[28] The collections were
   supplemented by the Bassae frieze from Phigaleia, Greece in 1815. The
   Ancient Near Eastern collection also had its beginnings in 1825 with
   the purchase of Assyrian and Babylonian antiquities from Mary
   Mackintosh Rich, the widow of Assyriologist Claudius James Rich.^[29]

   In 1802 a buildings committee was set up to plan for expansion of the
   museum, and further highlighted by the donation in 1822 of the King's
   Library, personal library of King George III, comprising 65,000
   volumes, 19,000 pamphlets, maps, charts and topographical
   drawings.^[30] The neoclassical architect, Sir Robert Smirke, was asked
   to draw up plans for an eastern extension to the museum "... for the
   reception of the Royal Library, and a Picture Gallery over it ..."^[31]
   and put forward plans for today's quadrangular building, much of which
   can be seen today. The dilapidated Old Montagu House was demolished and
   work on the King's Library Gallery began in 1823. The extension, the
   East Wing, was completed by 1831. However, following the founding of
   the National Gallery, London in 1824,^[e] the proposed Picture Gallery
   was no longer needed, and the space on the upper floor was given over
   to the Natural history collections.^[32]

   The first Synopsis of the British Museum was published in 1808. This
   described the contents of the museum, and the display of objects room
   by room, and updated editions were published every few years.

Largest building site in Europe (1825–1850)

   [edit]
   [250px-P8282318.1.JPG] Left to Right: Montagu House, Townley Gallery
   and Sir Robert Smirke's west wing under construction, July 1828

   As Sir Robert Smirke's grand neo-classical building gradually arose,
   the museum became a construction site. The King's Library, on the
   ground floor of the East Wing, was handed over in 1827, and was
   described as one of the finest rooms in London. Although it was not
   fully open to the general public until 1857, special openings were
   arranged during The Great Exhibition of 1851.
   [250px-Mauso03.JPG] The Mausoleum of Halicarnassus Room, 1920s

   In 1840, the museum became involved in its first overseas excavations,
   Charles Fellows's expedition to Xanthos, in Asia Minor, whence came
   remains of the tombs of the rulers of ancient Lycia, among them the
   Nereid and Payava monuments. In 1857, Charles Newton was to discover
   the 4th-century BC Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders
   of the Ancient World. In the 1840s and 1850s the museum supported
   excavations in Assyria by A.H. Layard and others at sites such as
   Nimrud and Nineveh. Of particular interest to curators was the eventual
   discovery of Ashurbanipal's great library of cuneiform tablets, which
   helped to make the museum a focus for Assyrian studies.^[33]
   [250px-Image-The_Grenville_Library_%281875%29.jpg] The Grenville
   Library, 1875

   Sir Thomas Grenville (1755–1846), a trustee of the British Museum from
   1830, assembled a library of 20,240 volumes, which he left to the
   museum in his will. The books arrived in January 1847 in twenty-one
   horse-drawn vans. The only vacant space for this large library was a
   room originally intended for manuscripts, between the Front Entrance
   Hall and the Manuscript Saloon. The books remained here until the
   British Library moved to St Pancras in 1998.

Collecting from the wider world (1850–1875)

   [edit]

   The opening of the forecourt in 1852 marked the completion of Robert
   Smirke's 1823 plan, but already adjustments were having to be made to
   cope with the unforeseen growth of the collections. Infill galleries
   were constructed for Assyrian sculptures and Sydney Smirke's Round
   Reading Room, with space for a million books, opened in 1857. Because
   of continued pressure on space the decision was taken to move natural
   history to a new building in South Kensington, which would later become
   the British Museum of Natural History.

   Roughly contemporary with the construction of the new building was the
   career of a man sometimes called the "second founder" of the British
   Museum, the Italian librarian Anthony Panizzi. Under his supervision,
   the British Museum Library (now part of the British Library) quintupled
   in size and became a well-organised institution worthy of being called
   a national library, the largest library in the world after the National
   Library of Paris.^[19] The quadrangle at the centre of Smirke's design
   proved to be a waste of valuable space and was filled at Panizzi's
   request by a circular Reading Room of cast iron, designed by Smirke's
   brother, Sydney Smirke.^[34]

   Until the mid-19th century, the museum's collections were relatively
   circumscribed but, in 1851, with the appointment to the staff of
   Augustus Wollaston Franks to curate the collections, the museum began
   for the first time to collect British and European medieval
   antiquities, prehistory, branching out into Asia and diversifying its
   holdings of ethnography. A real coup for the museum was the purchase in
   1867, over French objections, of the Duke of Blacas's wide-ranging and
   valuable collection of antiquities. Overseas excavations continued and
   John Turtle Wood discovered the remains of the 4th century BC Temple of
   Artemis at Ephesus, another Wonder of the Ancient World.^[35]

Scholarship and legacies (1875–1900)

   [edit]

   The natural history collections were an integral part of the British
   Museum until their removal to the new British Museum of Natural History
   in 1887, nowadays the Natural History Museum in South Kensington. With
   the departure and the completion of the new White Wing (fronting
   Montague Street) in 1884, more space was available for antiquities and
   ethnography and the library could further expand. This was a time of
   innovation as electric lighting was introduced in the Reading Room and
   exhibition galleries.^[36]

   The William Burges collection of armoury was bequeathed to the museum
   in 1881. In 1882, the museum was involved in the establishment of the
   independent Egypt Exploration Fund (now Society) the first British body
   to carry out research in Egypt. A bequest from Miss Emma Turner in 1892
   financed excavations in Cyprus. In 1897 the death of the great
   collector and curator, A. W. Franks, was followed by an immense bequest
   of 3,300 finger rings, 153 drinking vessels, 512 pieces of continental
   porcelain, 1,500 netsuke, 850 inro, over 30,000 bookplates and
   miscellaneous items of jewellery and plate, among them the Oxus
   Treasure.^[37]

   In 1898 Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild bequeathed the Waddesdon Bequest,
   the glittering contents from his New Smoking Room at Waddesdon Manor.
   This consisted of almost 300 pieces of objets d'art et de vertu which
   included exquisite examples of jewellery, plate, enamel, carvings,
   glass and maiolica, among them the Holy Thorn Reliquary, probably
   created in the 1390s in Paris for John, Duke of Berry. The collection
   was in the tradition of a Schatzkammer such as those formed by the
   Renaissance princes of Europe.^[38] Baron Ferdinand's will was most
   specific, and failure to observe the terms would make it void, the
   collection should be

     placed in a special room to be called the Waddesdon Bequest Room
     separate and apart from the other contents of the Museum and
     thenceforth for ever thereafter, keep the same in such room or in
     some other room to be substituted for it.^[38]

   These terms are still observed, and the collection occupies room 2a.

New century, new building (1900–1925)

   Wing, King Edward VII's Galleries, 1914

   By the last years of the 19th century, The British Museum's collections
   had increased to the extent that its building was no longer large
   enough. In 1895 the trustees purchased the 69 houses surrounding the
   museum with the intention of demolishing them and building around the
   west, north and east sides of the museum. The first stage was the
   construction of the northern wing beginning 1906.

   Leonard Woolley holding a plaster cast of the Sumerian Queen's Lyre,

   All the while, the collections kept growing. Emil Torday collected in
   Central Africa, Aurel Stein in Central Asia, D. G. Hogarth, Leonard
   Woolley and T. E. Lawrence excavated at Carchemish. Around this time,
   the American collector and philanthropist J. Pierpont Morgan donated a
   substantial number of objects to the museum,^[40] including William
   Greenwell's collection of prehistoric artefacts from across Europe
   which he had purchased for £10,000 in 1908. Morgan had also acquired a
   major part of Sir John Evans's coin collection, which was later sold to
   the museum by his son J. P. Morgan Jr. in 1915. In 1918, because of the
   threat of wartime bombing, some objects were evacuated via the London
   Post Office Railway to Holborn, the National Library of Wales
   (Aberystwyth) and a country house near Malvern. On the return of
   antiquities from wartime storage in 1919 some objects were found to
   have deteriorated. A conservation laboratory was set up in May 1920 and
   became a permanent department in 1931. It is today the oldest in
   continuous existence.^[41] In 1923, the British Museum welcomed over
   one million visitors.

Disruption and reconstruction (1925–1950)

   [edit]

   New mezzanine floors were constructed and book stacks rebuilt in an
   attempt to cope with the flood of books. In 1931, the art dealer Sir
   Joseph Duveen offered funds to build a gallery for the Parthenon
   sculptures. Designed by the American architect John Russell Pope, it
   was completed in 1938. The appearance of the exhibition galleries began
   to change as dark Victorian reds gave way to modern pastel shades.^[f]

   Following the retirement of George Francis Hill as Director and
   Principal Librarian in 1936, he was succeeded by John Forsdyke.

   As tensions with Nazi Germany developed and it appeared that war may be
   imminent Forsdyke came to the view that with the likelihood of far
   worse air-raids than that experienced in World War I that the museum
   had to make preparations to remove its most valuable items to secure
   locations. Following the Munich crisis Forsdyke ordered 3,300 No-Nail
   Boxes and stored them in the basement of the Duveen Gallery. At the
   same time he began identifying and securing suitable locations. As a
   result, the museum was able to quickly commence relocating selected
   items on 24 August 1939, (a mere day after the Home Secretary advised
   them to do so), to secure basements, country houses, Aldwych tube
   station and the National Library of Wales.^[43] Many items were
   relocated in early 1942 from their initial dispersal locations to a
   newly developed facility at Westwood Quarry in Wiltshire.^[43] The
   evacuation was timely, for in 1940 the Duveen Gallery was severely
   damaged by bombing.^[44] Meanwhile, prior to the war, the Nazis had
   sent a researcher to the British Museum for several years with the aim
   of "compiling an anti-Semitic history of Anglo-Jewry".^[45]

   After the war, the museum continued to collect from all countries and
   all centuries: among the most spectacular additions were the 2600 BC
   Mesopotamian treasure from Ur, discovered during Leonard Woolley's
   1922–34 excavations. Gold, silver and garnet grave goods from the
   Anglo-Saxon ship burial at Sutton Hoo (1939) and late Roman silver
   tableware from Mildenhall, Suffolk (1946). The immediate post-war years
   were taken up with the return of the collections from protection and
   the restoration of the museum after the Blitz. Work also began on
   restoring the damaged Duveen Gallery.

New public face (1950–1975)

   [edit]
   [250px-The_Duveen_Gallery_%281980s%29.jpg] The re-opened Duveen
   Gallery, 1980

   In 1953, the museum celebrated its bicentenary. Many changes followed:
   the first full-time in-house designer and publications officer were
   appointed in 1964, the Friends organisation was set up in 1968, an
   Education Service established in 1970 and publishing house in 1973. In
   1963, a new Act of Parliament introduced administrative reforms. It
   became easier to lend objects, the constitution of the board of
   trustees changed and the Natural History Museum became fully
   independent. By 1959 the Coins and Medals office suite, completely
   destroyed during the war, was rebuilt and re-opened, attention turned
   towards the gallery work with new tastes in design leading to the
   remodelling of Robert Smirke's Classical and Near Eastern
   galleries.^[46] In 1962 the Duveen Gallery was finally restored and the
   Parthenon Sculptures were moved back into it, once again at the heart
   of the museum.^[g]

   By the 1970s, the museum was again expanding. More services for the
   public were introduced; visitor numbers soared, with the temporary
   exhibition "Treasures of Tutankhamun" in 1972, attracting 1,694,117
   visitors, the most successful in British history. In the same year the
   Act of Parliament establishing the British Library was passed,
   separating the collection of manuscripts and printed books from the
   British Museum. This left the museum with antiquities; coins, medals
   and paper money; prints and drawings; and ethnography. A pressing
   problem was finding space for additions to the library which now
   required an extra
   1+1⁄4 miles (2.0 km) of shelving each year. The Government suggested a
   site at St Pancras for the new British Library but the books did not
   leave the museum until 1997.

Great Court emerges (1975–2000)

   [edit]

   The departure of the British Library to a new site at St Pancras,
   finally achieved in 1998, provided the space needed for the books. It
   also created the opportunity to redevelop the vacant space in Robert
   Smirke's 19th-century central quadrangle into the Queen Elizabeth II
   Great Court – the largest covered square in Europe – which opened in
   2000. The ethnography collections, which had been housed in the
   short-lived Museum of Mankind at 6 Burlington Gardens from 1970, were
   returned to new purpose-built galleries in the museum in 2000.

   The museum again readjusted its collecting policies as interest in
   "modern" objects: prints, drawings, medals and the decorative arts
   reawakened. Ethnographical fieldwork was carried out in places as
   diverse as New Guinea, Madagascar, Romania, Guatemala and Indonesia and
   there were excavations in the Near East, Egypt, Sudan and the UK. The
   Weston Gallery of Roman Britain, opened in 1997, displayed a number of
   recently discovered hoards which demonstrated the richness of what had
   been considered an unimportant part of the Roman Empire. The museum
   turned increasingly towards private funds for buildings, acquisitions
   and other purposes.^[48] In 2000, the British Museum was awarded
   National Heritage Museum of the Year.^[49]

British Museum today

   [edit]
   [330px-British_Museum_Great_Court%2C_London%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg] The
   Great Court was developed in 2001 and surrounds the original Reading
   Room.

   Today the museum no longer houses collections of natural history, and
   the books and manuscripts it once held now form part of the independent
   British Library. The museum nevertheless preserves its universality in
   its collections of artefacts representing the cultures of the world,
   ancient and modern. The original 1753 collection has grown to over
   13 million objects at the British Museum, 70 million at the Natural
   History Museum and 150 million at the British Library.

   The Round Reading Room, which was designed by the architect Sydney
   Smirke, opened in 1857. For almost 150 years researchers came here to
   consult the museum's vast library. The Reading Room closed in 1997 when
   the national library (the British Library) moved to a new building at
   St Pancras. Today it has been transformed into the Walter and Leonore
   Annenberg Centre.

   With the bookstacks in the central courtyard of the museum empty, the
   demolition for Lord Foster's glass-roofed Great Court could begin. The
   Great Court, opened in 2000, while undoubtedly improving circulation
   around the museum, was criticised for having a lack of exhibition space
   at a time when the museum was in serious financial difficulties and
   many galleries were closed to the public. At the same time the African
   collections that had been temporarily housed in 6 Burlington Gardens
   were given a new gallery in the North Wing funded by the Sainsbury
   family – with the donation valued at £25 million.^[50]

   The museum's online database had nearly 4,500,000 individual object
   entries in 2,000,000 records at the start of 2023.^[51] In 2022–23
   there were 27 million visits to the website.^[52] This compares with
   19.5 millions website visits in 2013.^[53]

   There were 5,820,860 visits to the museum in 2023, a 42% increase on
   2022. The museum was the most visited tourist attraction in Britain in
   2023. The number of visits, however, has not recovered to the level
   reached before the Covid pandemic.^[54]

   A number of films have been shot at the British Museum.^[55]

Governance

   [edit]

Director

   [edit]

   The British Museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the
   Department for Culture, Media and Sport through a three-year funding
   agreement. Its head is the Director of the British Museum. The British
   Museum was run from its inception by a 'principal librarian' (when the
   book collections were still part of the museum), a role that was
   renamed 'director and principal librarian' in 1898, and 'director' in
   1973 (on the separation of the British Library).^[56]

Trustees

   [edit]

   A board of 25 trustees (with the director as their accounting officer
   for the purposes of reporting to Government) is responsible for the
   general management and control of the museum, in accordance with the
   British Museum Act 1963 and the Museums and Galleries Act 1992.^[57]
   Prior to the 1963 Act, it was chaired by the Archbishop of Canterbury,
   the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker of the House of Commons. Of the 25
   trustees, 15 are appointed by the Prime Minister, one by the Crown,
   four by relevant industry bodies, with the remaining five appointed by
   other trustees.^[58] The board was formed on the museum's inception to
   hold its collections in trust for the nation without actually owning
   them themselves, and now fulfil a mainly advisory role. Trustee
   appointments are governed by the regulatory framework set out in the
   code of practice on public appointments issued by the Office of the
   Commissioner for Public Appointments.^[59]

Building

   [edit]
   [250px-British_Museum_from_NE_2_%28cropped%29.JPG] The museum's main
   entrance

   The Greek Revival façade facing Great Russell Street is a
   characteristic building of Sir Robert Smirke, with 43 columns in the
   Ionic order 45 ft (14 m) high, closely based on those of the temple of
   Athena Polias at Priene in Asia Minor.^[60] The pediment over the main
   entrance is decorated by sculptures by Sir Richard Westmacott depicting
   The Progress of Civilisation, consisting of fifteen allegorical
   figures, installed in 1852.^[61]

   The construction commenced around the courtyard with the East Wing
   (King's Library) in 1823–1828, followed by the North Wing in 1833–1838,
   which originally housed among other galleries a reading room, now the
   Wellcome Gallery. Work was also progressing on the northern half of the
   West Wing (The Egyptian Sculpture Gallery) 1826–1831, with Montagu
   House demolished in 1842 to make room for the final part of the West
   Wing, completed in 1846, and the South Wing with its great colonnade,
   initiated in 1843 and completed in 1847, when the Front Hall and Great
   Staircase were opened to the public.^[62] The museum is faced with
   Portland stone, but the perimeter walls and other parts of the building
   were built using Haytor granite from Dartmoor in South Devon,
   transported via the unique Haytor Granite Tramway.^[63]

   In 1846 Robert Smirke was replaced as the museum's architect by his
   brother Sydney Smirke, whose major addition was the Round Reading Room
   1854–1857; at 140 feet (43 m) in diameter it was then the second widest
   dome in the world, the Pantheon in Rome being slightly wider.

   The next major addition was the White Wing 1882–1884 added behind the
   eastern end of the South Front, the architect being Sir John Taylor.

   In 1895, Parliament gave the museum trustees a loan of £200,000 to
   purchase from the Duke of Bedford all 69 houses which backed onto the
   museum building in the five surrounding streets – Great Russell Street,
   Montague Street, Montague Place, Bedford Square and Bloomsbury
   Street.^[64] The trustees planned to demolish these houses and to build
   around the west, north and east sides of the museum new galleries that
   would completely fill the block on which the museum stands. The
   architect Sir John James Burnet was petitioned to put forward ambitious
   long-term plans to extend the building on all three sides. Most of the
   houses in Montague Place were knocked down a few years after the sale.
   Of this grand plan only the Edward VII galleries in the centre of the
   North Front were ever constructed, these were built 1906–14 to the
   design by J.J. Burnet, and opened by King George V and Queen Mary in
   1914. They now house the museum's collections of Prints and Drawings
   and Oriental Antiquities. There was not enough money to put up more new
   buildings, and so the houses in the other streets are nearly all still
   standing.

   The Duveen Gallery, sited to the west of the Egyptian, Greek & Assyrian
   sculpture galleries, was designed to house the Elgin Marbles by the
   American Beaux-Arts architect John Russell Pope. Although completed in
   1938, it was hit by a bomb in 1940 and remained semi-derelict for 22
   years, before reopening in 1962. Other areas damaged during World War
   II bombing included: in September 1940 two unexploded bombs hit the
   Edward VII galleries, the King's Library received a direct hit from a
   high explosive bomb, incendiaries fell on the dome of the Round Reading
   Room but did little damage; on the night of 10 to 11 May 1941 several
   incendiaries fell on the south-west corner of the museum, destroying
   the book stack and 150,000 books in the courtyard and the galleries
   around the top of the Great Staircase – this damage was not fully
   repaired until the early 1960s.^[65]
   [250px-British_Museum_Great_Court_roof.jpg] The Reading Room and Great
   Court roof, 2005

   The Queen Elizabeth II Great Court is a covered square at the centre of
   the British Museum designed by the engineers Buro Happold and the
   architects Foster and Partners.^[66] The Great Court opened in December
   2000 and is the largest covered square in Europe. The roof is a glass
   and steel construction, built by an Austrian steelwork company,^[67]
   with 1,656 uniquely shaped panes of glass. At the centre of the Great
   Court is the Reading Room vacated by the British Library, its functions
   now moved to St Pancras.

   Today, the British Museum has grown to become one of the largest
   museums in the world, covering an area of over 92,000 m^2 (990,000 sq.
   ft).^[68]^[failed verification]^[69] In addition to 21,600 m^2 (232,000
   sq. ft)^[70] of on-site storage space, and 9,400 m^2 (101,000 sq.
   ft)^[70] of external storage space. Altogether, the British Museum
   showcases on public display less than 1%^[70] of its entire collection,
   approximately 50,000 items.^[71]

   There are nearly one hundred galleries open to the public, representing
   2 miles (3.2 km) of exhibition space, although the less popular ones
   have restricted opening times. However, the lack of a large temporary
   exhibition space led to the £135 million World Conservation and
   Exhibitions Centre to provide one and to concentrate all the museum's
   conservation facilities into one centre. This project was announced in
   July 2007, with the architects Rogers Stirk Harbour and Partners. It
   was granted planning permission in December 2009 and was completed in
   time for the Viking exhibition in March 2014.^[72]^[73] In 2017, the
   World Conservation and Exhibitions Centre was shortlisted for the
   Stirling Prize for excellence in architecture.^[74]

   Blythe House in West Kensington was used by the museum for off-site
   storage of small and medium-sized artefacts until the British Museum
   Archeological Collection, a purpose-built storage facility near
   Reading, was opened in 2024.^[75] Another site Franks House in East
   London is used for storage and work on the "Early Prehistory" –
   Palaeolithic and Mesolithic – and some other collections.^[76]

Departments

   [edit]

Department of Egypt and Sudan

   [edit]
   [250px-TombofNebamun-2.jpg] Room 61 – The famous false fresco 'Pond in
   a Garden' from the Tomb of Nebamun, c. 1350 BC[250px-Rosetta_Stone.JPG]

   hieroglyphs, 196 BC

   The British Museum houses a collection of over 100,000 Egyptian
   antiquities from all periods and many sites of importance in Egypt and
   the Sudan.^[77] Together, they illustrate every aspect of the cultures
   of the Nile Valley (including Nubia), from the Predynastic Neolithic
   period (c. 10,000 BC) through Coptic (Christian) times (12th century
   AD), and up to the present day, a time-span over 11,000 years.^[78]

   Egyptian antiquities have formed part of the British Museum collection
   ever since its foundation in 1753 after receiving 160 Egyptian
   objects^[79] from Sir Hans Sloane. After the defeat of the French
   forces under Napoleon at the Battle of the Nile in 1801, the Egyptian
   antiquities collected were confiscated by the British army and
   presented to the British Museum in 1803. These works, which included
   the famed Rosetta Stone, were the first important group of large
   sculptures to be acquired by the museum. Thereafter, the UK appointed
   Henry Salt as consul in Egypt who amassed a huge collection of
   antiquities, some of which were assembled and transported with great
   ingenuity by the famous Italian explorer Giovanni Belzoni. Most of the
   antiquities Salt collected were purchased by the British Museum and the
   Musée du Louvre.

   By 1866, the collection consisted of some 10,000 objects. Antiquities
   from excavations started to come to the museum in the latter part of
   the 19th century as a result of the work of the Egypt Exploration Fund
   under the efforts of E. A. Wallis Budge. Over the years more than
   11,000 objects came from this source, including pieces from Amarna,
   Bubastis and Deir el-Bahari. Other organisations and individuals also
   excavated and donated objects to the British Museum, including Flinders
   Petrie's Egypt Research Account and the British School of Archaeology
   in Egypt, as well as the University of Oxford Expedition to Kawa and
   Faras in Sudan.

   Active support by the museum for excavations in Egypt continued to
   result in important acquisitions throughout the 20th century until
   changes in antiquities laws in Egypt led to the suspension of policies
   allowing finds to be exported, although divisions still continue in
   Sudan. The British Museum conducted its own excavations in Egypt where
   it received divisions of finds, including Asyut (1907), Mostagedda and
   Matmar (1920s), Ashmunein (1980s) and sites in Sudan such as Soba, Kawa
   and the Northern Dongola Reach (1990s). The size of the Egyptian
   collections now stand at over 110,000 objects.^[80]

   In autumn 2001, the eight million objects forming the museum's
   permanent collection were further expanded by the addition of six
   million objects from the Wendorf Collection of Egyptian and Sudanese
   Prehistory.^[81] These were donated by Professor Fred Wendorf of
   Southern Methodist University in Texas, and comprise the entire
   collection of artefacts and environmental remains from his excavations
   at Prehistoric sites in the Sahara Desert between 1963 and 1997. Other
   fieldwork collections have recently come from Dietrich and Rosemarie
   Klemm (University of Munich) and William Adams (University of
   Kentucky).

   The seven permanent Egyptian galleries at the British Museum, which
   include its largest exhibition space (Room 4, for monumental
   sculpture), can display only 4% of its Egyptian holdings. The
   second-floor galleries have a selection of the museum's collection of
   140 mummies and coffins, the largest outside Cairo. A high proportion
   of the collection comes from tombs or contexts associated with the cult
   of the dead, and it is these pieces, in particular the mummies, that
   remain among the most eagerly sought-after exhibits by visitors to the
   museum.

   Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient
   World, mid-4th century BC

   The British Museum has one of the world's largest and most
   comprehensive collections of antiquities from the Classical world, with
   over 100,000 objects.^[82] These mostly range in date from the
   beginning of the Greek Bronze Age (about 3200 BC) to the establishment
   of Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire, with the
   Edict of Milan under the reign of the Roman emperor Constantine I in
   313 AD. Archaeology was in its infancy during the nineteenth century
   and many pioneering individuals began excavating sites across the
   Classical world, chief among them for the museum were Charles Newton,
   John Turtle Wood, Robert Murdoch Smith and Charles Fellows.

   The Greek objects originate from across the Ancient Greek world, from
   the mainland of Greece and the Aegean Islands, to neighbouring lands in
   Asia Minor and Egypt in the eastern Mediterranean and as far as the
   western lands of Magna Graecia that include Sicily and southern Italy.
   The Cycladic, Minoan and Mycenaean cultures are represented, and the
   Greek collection includes important sculpture from the Parthenon in
   Athens, as well as elements of two of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient
   World, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus and the Temple of Artemis at
   Ephesus.^[82]

   Beginning from the early Bronze Age, the department also houses one of
   the widest-ranging collections of Italic and Etruscan antiquities
   outside Italy, as well as extensive groups of material from Cyprus and
   non-Greek colonies in Lycia and Caria on Asia Minor. There is some
   material from the Roman Republic, but the collection's strength is in
   its comprehensive array of objects from across the Roman Empire, with
   the exception of Britain (which is the mainstay of the Department of
   Prehistory and Europe).

   The collections of ancient jewellery and bronzes, Greek vases (many
   from graves in southern Italy that were once part of Sir William
   Hamilton's and Chevalier Durand's collections), Roman glass including
   the famous Cameo glass Portland Vase, Roman gold glass (the second
   largest collection after the Vatican Museums), Roman mosaics from
   Carthage and Utica in North Africa that were excavated by Nathan Davis,
   and silver hoards from Roman Gaul (some of which were bequeathed by the
   philanthropist and museum trustee Richard Payne Knight), are
   particularly important. Cypriot antiquities are strong too and have
   benefited from the purchase of Sir Robert Hamilton Lang's collection as
   well as the bequest of Emma Turner in 1892, which funded many
   excavations on the island. Roman sculptures (many of which are copies
   of Greek originals) are particularly well represented by the Townley
   collection as well as residual sculptures from the famous Farnese
   collection.

   Objects from the Department of Greece and Rome are located throughout
   the museum, although many of the architectural monuments are to be
   found on the ground floor, with connecting galleries from Gallery 5 to
   Gallery 23. On the upper floor, there are galleries devoted to smaller
   material from ancient Italy, Greece, Cyprus and the Roman Empire.

   With a collection numbering some 330,000 works,^[87] the British Museum
   possesses the world's largest and most important collection of
   Mesopotamian antiquities outside Iraq. A collection of immense
   importance, the holdings of Assyrian sculpture, Babylonian and Sumerian
   antiquities are among the most comprehensive in the world with entire
   suites of rooms panelled in alabaster Assyrian palace reliefs from
   Nimrud, Nineveh and Khorsabad.

   The collections represent the civilisations of the ancient Near East
   and its adjacent areas. These cover Mesopotamia, Persia, the Arabian
   Peninsula, Anatolia, the Caucasus, parts of Central Asia, Syria, the
   Holy Land and Phoenician settlements in the western Mediterranean from
   the prehistoric period and include objects from the 7th century.

   The first significant addition of Mesopotamian objects was from the
   collection of Claudius James Rich in 1825. The collection was later
   dramatically enlarged by the excavations of A. H. Layard at the
   Assyrian sites of Nimrud and Nineveh between 1845 and 1851. At Nimrud,
   Layard discovered the North-West Palace of Ashurnasirpal II, as well as
   three other palaces and various temples. He later uncovered the Palace
   of Sennacherib at Nineveh with 'no less than seventy-one halls'. As a
   result, a large numbers of Lamassus, palace reliefs, stelae, including
   the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III, were brought to the British
   Museum.

   Layard's work was continued by his assistant, Hormuzd Rassam and in
   1852–1854 he went on to discover the North Palace of Ashurbanipal at
   Nineveh with many magnificent reliefs, including the famous Lion Hunt
   of Ashurbanipal and Lachish reliefs. He also discovered the Royal
   Library of Ashurbanipal, a large collection of cuneiform tablets of
   enormous importance that today number around 130,000 pieces. W. K.
   Loftus excavated in Nimrud between 1850 and 1855 and found a remarkable
   hoard of ivories in the Burnt Palace. Between 1878 and 1882 Rassam
   greatly improved the museum's holdings with exquisite objects including
   the Cyrus Cylinder from Babylon, the bronze gates from Balawat,
   important objects from Sippar, and a fine collection of Urartian
   bronzes from Toprakkale including a copper figurine of a winged,
   human-headed bull.

   In the early 20th century excavations were carried out at Carchemish,
   Turkey by D. G. Hogarth and Leonard Woolley, the latter assisted by T.
   E. Lawrence. The Mesopotamian collections were greatly augmented by
   excavations in southern Iraq after World War I. From Tell al-Ubaid came
   the bronze furnishings of a Sumerian temple, including life-sized lions
   and a panel featuring the lion-headed eagle Indugud found by H. R. Hall
   in 1919–24. Woolley went on to excavate Ur between 1922 and 1934,
   discovering the Royal Cemeteries of the 3rd millennium BC. Some of the
   masterpieces include the Standard of Ur, the Ram in a Thicket, the
   Royal Game of Ur, and two bull-headed lyres. The department also has
   three diorite statues of the ruler Gudea from the ancient state of
   Lagash and a series of limestone kudurru or boundary stones from
   different locations across ancient Mesopotamia.

   Although the collections centre on Mesopotamia, most of the surrounding
   areas are well represented. The Achaemenid collection was enhanced with
   the addition of the Oxus Treasure in 1897 and objects excavated by the
   German scholar Ernst Herzfeld and the Hungarian-British explorer Sir
   Aurel Stein. Reliefs and sculptures from the site of Persepolis were
   donated by Sir Gore Ouseley in 1825 and the 5th Earl of Aberdeen in
   1861 and the museum received part of a pot-hoard of jewellery from
   Pasargadae as the division of finds in 1963 and part of the Ziwiye
   hoard in 1971. A large column base from the One Hundred Column Hall at
   Persepolis was acquired in exchange from the Oriental Institute,
   Chicago. Moreover, the museum has been able to acquire one of the
   greatest assemblages of Achaemenid silverware in the world. The later
   Sasanian Empire is also well represented by ornate silver plates and
   cups, many representing ruling monarchs hunting lions and deer.
   Phoenician antiquities come from across the region, but the Tharros
   collection from Sardinia, the hoard of about 150 metal bowls and
   hundreds of ivories from Nimrud, Phœnician inscriptions from Carthage
   including the Son of Baalshillek marble base, the Carthage Tariff and
   the Carthage tower model and the many punic stelae from Carthage and
   Maghrawa in Tunisia (such as the Ghorafa stelae [fr]) are outstanding.
   The number of Phoenician inscriptions from sites across Cyprus is also
   considerable, and include artefacts found at the Kition necropolis
   (with the two Kition Tariffs having the longest Phoenician inscription
   discovered on the island), the Idalion temple site and two bilingual
   pedestals found at Tamassos. Another often overlooked highlight is
   Yemeni antiquities, the finest collection outside that country.
   Furthermore, the museum has a representative collection of Dilmun and
   Parthian material excavated from various burial mounds at the ancient
   sites of A'ali and Shakhura (that included a Roman ribbed glass bowl)
   in Bahrain.

   From the modern state of Syria come almost forty funerary busts from
   Palmyra and a group of stone reliefs from the excavations of Max von
   Oppenheim at Tell Halaf that was purchased in 1920. More material
   followed from the excavations of Max Mallowan at Chagar Bazar and Tell
   Brak in 1935–1938 and from Woolley at Alalakh in the years just before
   and after World War II. Mallowan returned with his wife Agatha Christie
   to carry out further digs at Nimrud in the postwar period which secured
   many important artefacts, such as the Nimrud Ivories, for the museum.
   The collection of Palestinian material was strengthened by the work of
   Kathleen Kenyon at Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) in the 1950s and the
   acquisition in 1980 of around 17,000 objects found at Lachish by the
   Wellcome-Marston expedition of 1932–1938. Archaeological digs are still
   taking place where permitted in the Middle East, and, depending on the
   country, the museum continues to receive a share of the finds from
   sites such as Tell es Sa'idiyeh [de] in Jordan.

   The museum's collection of Islamic art, including archaeological
   material, numbers about 40,000 objects,^[88] one of the largest of its
   kind in the world. As such, it contains a broad range of pottery,
   paintings, tiles, metalwork, glass, seals, and inscriptions from across
   the Islamic world, from Spain in the west to India in the east. It is
   particularly famous for its collection of Iznik ceramics (the largest
   in the world), its large number of mosque lamps including one from the
   Dome of the Rock, mediaeval metalwork such as the Vaso Vescovali with
   its depictions of the Zodiac, a fine selection of astrolabes, and
   Mughal paintings and precious artwork including a large jade terrapin
   made for the emperor Jahangir. Thousands of objects were excavated
   after the war by professional archaeologists at Iranian sites such as
   Siraf by David Whitehouse and Alamut Castle by Peter Willey. The
   collection was augmented in 1983 by the Godman bequest of Iznik,
   Hispano-Moresque and early Iranian pottery. Artefacts from the Islamic
   world are on display in Gallery 34 of the museum.

   A representative selection from the Department of Middle East,
   including the most important pieces, are on display in 13 galleries
   throughout the museum and total some 4,500 objects. A whole suite of
   rooms on the ground floor display the sculptured reliefs from the
   Assyrian palaces at Nineveh, Nimrud and Khorsabad, while 8 galleries on
   the upper floor hold smaller material from ancient sites across the
   Middle East. The remainder form the study collection which ranges in
   size from beads to large sculptures. They include approximately 130,000
   cuneiform tablets from Mesopotamia.^[89]

Department of Prints and Drawings

   [edit]

   The Department of Prints and Drawings holds the national collection of
   Western prints and drawings. It ranks as one of the largest and best
   print room collections in existence alongside the Albertina in Vienna,
   the Paris collections^[vague] and the Hermitage. The holdings are
   easily accessible to the general public in the Study Room, unlike many
   such collections.^[90] The department also has its own exhibition
   gallery in Room 90, where the displays and exhibitions change several
   times a year.^[91]

   Since its foundation in 1808, the prints and drawings collection has
   grown to international renown as one of the richest and most
   representative collections in the world. There are approximately 50,000
   drawings and over two million prints.^[91] The collection of drawings
   covers the period from the 14th century to the present, and includes
   many works of the highest quality by the leading artists of the
   European schools. The collection of prints covers the tradition of fine
   printmaking from its beginnings in the 15th century up to the present,
   with near complete holdings of most of the great names before the 19th
   century. Key benefactors to the department have been Clayton Mordaunt
   Cracherode, Richard Payne Knight, John Malcolm, Campbell Dodgson, César
   Mange de Hauke and Tomás Harris. Writer and author Louis Alexander
   Fagan, who worked in the department 1869–1894 made significant
   contributions to the department in form of his Handbook to the
   Department, as well as various other books about the museum in
   general.^[92]

   There are groups of drawings by Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael,
   Michelangelo, (including his only surviving full-scale cartoon),
   Albrecht Dürer (a collection of 138 drawings is one of the finest in
   existence), Peter Paul Rubens, Rembrandt, Claude Lorrain and Antoine
   Watteau, and largely complete collections of the works of all the great
   printmakers including Dürer (99 engravings, 6 etchings and most of his
   346 woodcuts), Rembrandt and Francisco Goya. More than 30,000 British
   drawings and watercolours include important examples of work by William
   Hogarth, Paul Sandby, J. M. W. Turner, Thomas Girtin, John Constable,
   John Sell Cotman, David Cox, James Gillray, Thomas Rowlandson, Francis
   Towne and George Cruikshank, as well as all the great Victorians. The
   collection contains the unique set of watercolours by the pioneering
   colonist John White, the first British artist in America and first
   European to paint Native Americans. There are about a million British
   prints including more than 20,000 satires and outstanding collections
   of works by William Blake and Thomas Bewick.^[citation needed]. The
   great eleven volume Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires
   Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British
   Museum compiled between 1870 and 1954 is the definitive reference work
   for the study of British Satirical prints. Over 500,000 objects from
   the department are now on the online collection database, many with
   high-quality images.^[93] A 2011 donation of £1 million enabled the
   museum to acquire a complete set of Pablo Picasso's Vollard Suite.^[94]

   The Department of Britain, Europe and Prehistory is responsible for
   collections that cover a vast expanse of time and geography. It
   includes some of the earliest objects made by humans in east Africa
   over 2 million years ago, as well as Prehistoric and neolithic objects
   from other parts of the world; and the art and archaeology of Europe
   from the earliest times to the present day. Archeological excavation of
   prehistoric material took off and expanded considerably in the
   twentieth century and the department now has literally millions of
   objects from the Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods throughout the
   world, as well as from the Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age in
   Europe. Stone Age material from Africa has been donated by famous
   archaeologists such as Louis and Mary Leakey, and Gertrude
   Caton–Thompson. Paleolithic objects from the Sturge, Christy and Lartet
   collections include some of the earliest works of art from Europe. Many
   Bronze Age objects from across Europe were added during the nineteenth
   century, often from large collections built up by excavators and
   scholars such as Greenwell in Britain, Tobin and Cooke in Ireland,
   Lukis and de la Grancière in Brittany, Worsaae in Denmark, Siret at El
   Argar in Spain, and Klemm and Edelmann in Germany. A representative
   selection of Iron Age artefacts from Hallstatt were acquired as a
   result of the Evans/Lubbock excavations and from Giubiasco in Ticino
   through the Swiss National Museum.

   In addition, the British Museum's collections covering the period AD
   300 to 1100 are among the largest and most comprehensive in the world,
   extending from Spain to the Black Sea and from North Africa to
   Scandinavia; a representative selection of these has recently been
   redisplayed in a newly refurbished gallery. Important collections
   include Latvian, Norwegian, Gotlandic and Merovingian material from
   Johann Karl Bähr, Alfred Heneage Cocks, Sir James Curle and Philippe
   Delamain respectively. However, the undoubted highlight from the early
   mediaeval period is the magnificent items from the Sutton Hoo royal
   grave, generously donated to the nation by the landowner Edith Pretty.
   The late mediaeval collection includes a large number of seal-dies from
   across Europe, the most famous of which include those from the Town of
   Boppard in Germany, Isabella of Hainault from her tomb in Notre Dame
   Cathedral, Paris, Inchaffray Abbey in Scotland and Robert Fitzwalter,
   one of the Barons who led the revolt against King John in England.
   There is also a large collection of medieval signet rings, prominent
   among them is the gold signet ring belonging to Jean III de Grailly who
   fought in the Hundred Years' War, as well as those of Mary, Queen of
   Scots and Richard I of England. Other groups of artefacts represented
   in the department include the national collection of (c.100) icon
   paintings, most of which originate from the Byzantine Empire and
   Russia, and over 40 mediaeval astrolabes from across Europe and the
   Middle East. The department also includes the national collection of
   horology with one of the most wide-ranging assemblage of clocks,
   watches and other timepieces in Europe, with masterpieces from every
   period in the development of time-keeping. Choice horological pieces
   came from the Morgan and Ilbert collections. The department is also
   responsible for the curation of Romano-British objects – the museum has
   by far the most extensive such collection in Britain and one of the
   most representative regional collections in Europe outside Italy. It is
   particularly famous for the large number of late Roman silver
   treasures, many of which were found in East Anglia, the most important
   of which is the Mildenhall Treasure. The museum purchased many
   Roman-British objects from the antiquarian Charles Roach Smith in 1856.
   These quickly formed the nucleus of the collection. The department also
   includes ethnographic material from across Europe including a
   collection of Bulgarian costumes and shadow puppets from Greece and
   Turkey. A particular highlight are the three Sámi drums from northern
   Sweden of which only about 70 are extant.

   Objects from the Department of Britain, Europe and Prehistory are
   mostly found on the upper floor of the museum, with a suite of
   galleries numbered from 38 to 51. Most of the collection is stored in
   its archive facilities, where it is available for research and study.

Department of Asia

   [edit]

   [250px-BrMus_Amravati.jpg] Room 33a – Amaravati Sculptures, southern
   India, 1st century BC and 3rd century AD[250px-Room_95-6752.JPG] Room
   95 – The Percival David collection of Chinese ceramics

   The scope of the Department of Asia is extremely broad; its collections
   of over 75,000 objects cover the material culture of the whole Asian
   continent and from the Neolithic up to the present day. Until recently,
   this department concentrated on collecting Oriental antiquities from
   urban or semi-urban societies across the Asian continent. Many of those
   objects were collected by colonial officers and explorers in former
   parts of the British Empire, especially the Indian
   subcontinent.^[100]^[101]^[102] Examples include the collections made
   by individuals such as James Wilkinson Breeks, Sir Alexander
   Cunningham, Sir Harold Deane, Sir Walter Elliot, James Prinsep, Charles
   Masson, Sir John Marshall and Charles Stuart.

   A large number of Chinese antiquities were purchased from the
   Anglo-Greek banker George Eumorfopoulos in the 1930s. The large
   collection of some 1,800 Japanese prints and paintings owned by Arthur
   Morrison was acquired in the early twentieth century. In the second
   half of the twentieth century, the museum greatly benefited from the
   bequest of the philanthropist PT Brooke Sewell, which allowed the
   department to purchase many objects and fill in gaps in the
   collection.^[100]^[101]^[102]

   In 2004, the ethnographic collections from Asia were transferred to the
   department. These reflect the diverse environment of the largest
   continent in the world and range from India to China, the Middle East
   to Japan. Much of the ethnographic material comes from objects
   originally owned by tribal cultures and hunter-gatherers, many of whose
   way of life has disappeared in the last century.

   Particularly valuable collections are from the Andaman and Nicobar
   Islands (much assembled by the British naval officer Maurice Portman),
   Sri Lanka (especially through the colonial administrator Hugh Nevill),
   Northern Thailand, south-west China, the Ainu of Hokkaido in Japan
   (chief among them the collection of the Scottish zoologist John
   Anderson), Siberia (with artefacts collected by the explorer Kate
   Marsden and Bassett Digby and is notable for its Sakha pieces,
   especially the ivory model of a summer festival at Yakutsk) and the
   islands of South-East Asia, especially Borneo. The latter benefited
   from the purchase in 1905 of the Sarawak collection put together by Dr
   Charles Hose, as well as from other colonial officers such as Edward A
   Jeffreys. A unique and valuable group of objects from Java, including
   shadow puppets and a gamelan musical set, was assembled by Sir Stamford
   Raffles.

   The principal gallery devoted to Asian art in the museum is Gallery 33
   with its comprehensive display of Chinese, Indian subcontinent and
   South-east Asian objects. An adjacent gallery showcases the Amaravati
   sculptures and monuments. Other galleries on the upper floors are
   devoted to its Japanese, Korean, painting and calligraphy, and Chinese
   ceramics collections.

   Highlights of the collections include:^[103]

       subcontinent, including some of the Amaravati Marbles, Buddhist

   The British Museum houses one of the world's most comprehensive
   collections of ethnographic material from Africa, Oceania and the
   Americas, representing the cultures of indigenous peoples throughout
   the world. Over 350,000 objects^[105] spanning thousands of years tells
   the history of mankind from three major continents and many rich and
   diverse cultures; the collecting of modern artefacts is ongoing. Many
   individuals have added to the department's collection over the years
   but those assembled by Henry Christy, Harry Beasley and William Oldman
   are outstanding.

   Objects from this department are mostly on display in several galleries
   on the ground and lower floors. Gallery 24 displays ethnographic from
   every continent while adjacent galleries focus on North America and
   Mexico. A long suite of rooms (Gallery 25) on the lower floor display
   African art. There are plans in place to develop permanent galleries
   for displaying art from Oceania and South America.

Africa

   [edit]

   The Sainsbury African Galleries display 600 objects from the greatest
   permanent collection of African arts and culture in the world. The
   three permanent galleries provide a substantial exhibition space for
   the museum's African collection comprising over 200,000 objects. A
   curatorial scope that encompasses both archaeological and contemporary
   material, including both unique masterpieces of artistry and objects of
   everyday life. A great addition was material amassed by Sir Henry
   Wellcome, which was donated by the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum
   in 1954.

   Highlights of the African collection include objects found at
   megalithic circles in The Gambia, a dozen exquisite Afro-Portuguese
   ivories, a series of soapstone figures from the Kissi people in Sierra
   Leone and Liberia, hoard of bronze Kru currency rings from the Sinoe
   River in Liberia, Asante goldwork and regalia from Ghana including the
   Bowdich collection, the rare Akan Drum from the same region in west
   Africa, pair of door panels and lintel from the palace at Ikere-Ekiti
   in Yorubaland, the Benin and Igbo-Ukwu bronze sculptures, the beautiful
   Bronze Head of Queen Idia, a magnificent brass head of a Yoruba ruler
   and quartz throne from Ife, a similar terracotta head from Iwinrin
   Grove near Ife, the Apapa Hoard from Lagos and other mediaeval bronze
   hoards from Allabia and the Forçados River in southern Nigeria.

   Included is an Ikom monolith from Cross River State, several ancestral
   screens from the Kalabari tribe in the Niger Delta, the Torday
   collection of central African sculpture, textiles and weaponry from the
   Kuba Kingdom including three royal figures, the unique Luzira Head from
   Uganda, processional crosses and other ecclesiastical and royal
   material from Gondar and Magdala, Ethiopia following the British
   Expedition to Abyssinia, excavated objects from Great Zimbabwe (that
   includes a unique soapstone, anthropomorphic figure) and satellite
   towns such as Mutare including a large hoard of Iron Age soapstone
   figures, a rare divining bowl from the Venda peoples and cave paintings
   and petroglyphs from South Africa.

Oceania

   [edit]

   The British Museum's Oceanic collections originate from the vast area
   of the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Papua New Guinea to Easter
   Island, from New Zealand to Hawaii. The three main anthropological
   groups represented in the collection are Polynesia, Melanesia and
   Micronesia – Aboriginal art from Australia is considered separately in
   its own right. Metal working was not indigenous to Oceania before
   Europeans arrived, so many of the artefacts from the collection are
   made from stone, shell, bone and bamboo. Prehistoric objects from the
   region include a bird-shaped pestle and a group of stone mortars from
   Papua New Guinea.

   The British Museum is fortunate in having some of the earliest Oceanic
   and Pacific collections, many of which were put together by members of
   Cook's and Vancouver's expeditions or by colonial administrators and
   explorers such as Sir George Grey, Sir Frederick Broome, Joseph
   Bradshaw, Robert Christison, Gregory Mathews, Frederick Meinertzhagen,
   Thomas Mitchell and Arthur Gordon, before Western culture significantly
   impacted on indigenous cultures. The department has also benefited
   greatly from the legacy of pioneering anthropologists such as AC
   Haddon, Bronisław Malinowski and Katherine Routledge. An important
   artefact is a wooden Aboriginal shield, probably dating from the late
   eighteenth century and one of the earliest precontact objects from
   Australia.^[106]

   The Wilson cabinet of curiosities from Palau is an example of
   pre-contact ware. Another outstanding exemplar is the mourner's dress
   from Tahiti given to Cook on his second voyage, one of only ten in
   existence. In the collection is a large war canoe from the island of
   Vella Lavella in the Solomon Islands, one of the last ever to be built
   in the archipelago.^[107]

   The Māori collection is the finest outside New Zealand with many
   intricately carved wooden and jade objects and the Aboriginal art
   collection is distinguished by its wide range of bark paintings,
   including two very early bark etchings collected by John Hunter Kerr. A
   particularly important group of objects was purchased from the London
   Missionary Society in 1911, that includes the unique statue of A'a from
   Rurutu Island, the rare idol from the isle of Mangareva and the Cook
   Islands deity figure. Other highlights include the huge Hawaiian statue
   of Kū-ka-ili-moku or god of war (one of three extant in the world) and
   the famous Easter Island statues Hoa Hakananai'a and Moai Hava.

Americas

   [edit]

   The Americas collection mainly consists of 19th and 20th century items
   although the Paracas, Moche, Inca, Maya, Aztec, Taino and other early
   cultures are well represented. The Kayung totem pole, which was made in
   the late nineteenth century on Haida Gwaii, dominates the Great Court
   and provides a fitting introduction to this very wide-ranging
   collection that stretches from the very north of the North American
   continent where the Inuit population has lived for centuries, to the
   tip of South America where indigenous tribes have long thrived in
   Patagonia.

   Highlights of the collection include Aboriginal Canadian and Native
   American objects from North America collected by the 5th Earl of
   Lonsdale, the Marquis of Lorne, the explorer David Haig-Thomas and
   Bryan Mullanphy, Mayor of St. Louis, the Squier and Davis collection of
   prehistoric mound relics from North America, two carved stone bowls in
   the form of a seated human figure made by ancient North West Coast
   peoples from British Columbia, the headdress of Chief Yellow Calf from
   the Arapaho tribe in Wyoming, a lidded rivercane basket from South
   Carolina and the earliest historic example of Cherokee basketry, a
   selection of pottery vessels found in prehistoric dwellings at Mesa
   Verde and Casas Grandes, one of the enigmatic crystal skulls of unknown
   origin, a collection of nine turquoise Aztec mosaics from Mexico (the
   largest in Europe), important artefacts from Teotihuacan and Isla de
   Sacrificios.

   There are several rare pre-Columbian manuscripts including the Codex
   Zouche-Nuttall and Codex Waecker-Gotter and post-colonial ones such as
   the Codex Aubin and Codex Kingsborough, a spectacular series of Mayan
   lintels from Yaxchilan excavated by the British Mayanist Alfred
   Maudslay, a very high quality Mayan collection that includes sculptures
   from Copan, Tikal, Tulum, Pusilha, Naranjo and Nebaj (including the
   celebrated Fenton Vase), an ornate calcite vase with jaguar handles
   from the Ulua Valley in Honduras, the Lord Moyne collection from the
   Bay Islands, Honduras and Boyle collection from Nicaragua, over 20
   stone metates with zoomorphic and anthropomorphic ornamentation from
   Costa Rica, a group of Zemi Figures from Vere, Jamaica, and wooden
   duhos from the Dominican Republic and The Bahamas.

   There are a collection of Pre-Columbian human mummies from sites across
   South America including Ancon, Acari, Arica and Leyva, a number of
   prestigious pre-Columbian gold and votive objects from Colombia, three
   axe-shaped gold diadems found near Camaná from the Siguas culture in
   Peru, unique collection of Moche wooden figures and staffs from the
   Macabi islands [es] off Peru, ethnographic objects from across the
   Amazon region including the Schomburgk and Maybury Lewis collections
   and part of the von Martius and von Spix collection, two rare Tiwanaku
   pottery vessels from Lake Titicaca and important items from Tierra del
   Fuego donated by Commander Phillip Parker King.

Department of Money and Medals

   [edit]

   Main article: British Museum Department of Coins and Medals

   The British Museum is home to one of the world's finest numismatic
   collections, comprising about a million objects, including coins,
   medals, tokens and paper money. The collection spans the entire history
   of coinage from its origins in the 7th century BC to the present day
   and is representative of both the East and West. The Department of
   Coins and Medals was created in 1861 and celebrated its 150th
   anniversary in 2011.^[108]

Department of Conservation and Scientific Research

   [edit]

   This department was founded in 1920. Conservation has six specialist
   areas: ceramics & glass; metals; organic material (including textiles);
   stone, wall paintings and mosaics; Eastern pictorial art and Western
   pictorial art. The science department^[109] has and continues to
   develop techniques to date artefacts, analyse and identify the
   materials used in their manufacture, to identify the place an artefact
   originated and the techniques used in their creation. The department
   also publishes its findings and discoveries.

Libraries and archives

   [edit]

   This department covers all levels of education, from casual visitors,
   schools, degree level and beyond. The museum's various libraries hold
   in excess of 350,000 books, journals and pamphlets covering all areas
   of the museum's collection. Also the general museum archives which date
   from its foundation in 1753 are overseen by this department; the
   individual departments have their own separate archives and libraries
   covering their various areas of responsibility, which can be consulted
   by the public on application. The Anthropology Library is especially
   large, with 120,000 volumes.^[110] However, the Paul Hamlyn Library,
   which had become the central reference library of the British Museum
   and the only library there freely open to the general public, closed
   permanently in August 2011.^[111] The website and online database of
   the collection also provide increasing amounts of information.

British Museum Press

   [edit]

   The British Museum Press (BMP) is the publishing business and a
   division of the British Museum Company Ltd., a company and a charity
   (established in 1973) wholly owned by the trustees of the British
   Museum.^[112]

   The BMP publishes both popular and scholarly illustrated books to
   accompany the exhibition programme and explore aspects of the general
   collection. Profits from their sales goes to support the British
   Museum.^[112]

   Scholarly titles are published in the Research Publications series, all
   of which are peer-reviewed. This series was started in 1978 and was
   originally called Occasional Papers. The series is designed to
   disseminate research on items in the collection. To date, over 200
   books have been published in this series. Between six and eight titles
   are published each year in this series.^[113] They can be found on the
   British Museum Research Repository.

Controversies and criticism

   [edit]

Contested artefacts

   [edit]

   [250px-Elgin_Marbles_east_pediment.jpg] A few of the Elgin Marbles
   (also known as the Parthenon Marbles) from the East Pediment of the
   Parthenon in Athens.

   It is a point of controversy whether museums should possess artefacts
   illegally taken from other countries,^[7]^[114] and the British Museum
   is a notable target for criticism. The Elgin Marbles, the Benin
   Bronzes, Ethiopian Tabots and the Rosetta Stone are among the most
   disputed objects in its collections, and organisations have been formed
   demanding the return of these artefacts to their native countries.

   The Elgin Marbles or Parthenon Marbles claimed by Greece have been
   cited by UNESCO, among others, for restitution. From 1801 to 1812,
   Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin's agents removed about half of the
   surviving sculptures from the Parthenon, as well as sculptures from the
   Propylaea and Erechtheion. The former director of the museum has
   stated, "We are indebted to Elgin for having rescued the Parthenon
   sculptures and others from the Acropolis from the destruction they were
   suffering, as well as from the damage that the Acropolis monuments,
   including the sculptures that he did not remove, have suffered
   since."^[115] The British Museum itself damaged some of the artefacts
   during restoration in the 1930s.^[116] In late 2022, the British Museum
   had entered into preliminary negotiations with the Greek government
   about the future of the sculptures.^[117]

   There is also controversy over artefacts taken during the destruction
   of the Old Summer Palace in Beijing by an Anglo-French expeditionary
   force during the Second Opium War in 1860, an event which drew protest
   from Victor Hugo.^[118]^[119] The British Museum and the Victoria and
   Albert Museum, among others, have been asked since 2009 to open their
   archives for investigation by a team of Chinese investigators as a part
   of an international mission to document Chinese national treasures in
   foreign collections.^[120] In 2010 Neil MacGregor, the former Director
   of the British Museum, said he hoped that both British and Chinese
   investigators would work together on the controversial
   collection.^[121] In 2020 the museum appointed a curator to research
   the history of its collections, including disputed items.^[122]

   The British Museum has stated that the "restitutionist premise, that
   whatever was made in a country must return to an original geographical
   site, would empty both the British Museum and the other great museums
   of the world".^[123] The museum has also argued that the British Museum
   Act of 1963 prevents any object from leaving its collection once it has
   entered it. "The Museum owns its collections, but its Trustees are not
   empowered to dispose of them".^[123]^[124] Nevertheless, it has
   returned items such as Tasmanian Aboriginal burial remains when this
   was consistent with legislation regarding the disposal of items in the
   collections.^[125]

   [edit]

     * Elgin Marbles – claimed by Greece and backed by UNESCO among others
       for restitution^[126]^[127]
     * Benin Bronzes – claimed by Nigeria; the Nigerian government has
       passed a resolution demanding the return of all 700 bronze
       pieces.^[128] 30 pieces of the bronzes were sold by the British
       Museum privately from the 1950s until 1972, mostly back to the
       Nigerians.^[129]

       Peled for the amount of £175,000 by the British Museum^[147]
     * Repatriation and reburial of human remains is a controversial
       issue, and the British Museum has issued a policy on the
       subject.^[148]

Nazi-looted art

   [edit]

   In 2002 the heirs of Arthur Feldmann, an art collector murdered in the
   Holocaust, requested that four old master drawings stolen by the
   Gestapo in 1939 be returned to the family. A High Court of Justice
   judge ruled in 2005 that it would be illegal for the British Museum to
   return artworks looted by the Nazis to a Jewish family, despite its
   willingness and moral obligation to do so.^[149]^[150] The law was
   changed in 2009,^[151] and again in 2022^[152] giving museums
   additional powers to return looted art or provide compensation.
   Feldmann's heirs accepted a compensation payment for a looted drawing
   and stated that they were happy the drawing would remain in the British
   Museum collection.^[153]

   According to the British Museum Spoliation report published by the
   Collections Trust in 2017, "Around 30% of some 21,350 continental and
   British drawings acquired since 1933 have an uncertain or incomplete
   provenance for the 1933–1945 period".^[154] The museum lists these
   works on its website and investigates claims for restitution.^[155]

BP sponsorship

   [edit]

   Since 2016, there have been a number of protests by activist groups,
   trade unions and the public against the British Museum's relationship
   with the oil company BP which the protesters believe implicates the
   museum in global warming.^[156] In July 2019, Ahdaf Soueif resigned
   from the British Museum's board of trustees in protest against the
   sponsorship.^[157] In February 2020, 1,500 demonstrators, including
   British Museum staff, took part in a day of protest over the
   issue.^[158] In December 2023, it was announced that the British Museum
   had agreed to a new £50 million sponsorship deal with BP.^[159]

Chairman's Advisory Group

   [edit]

   The Chairman's Advisory Group is an informal group of business leaders
   who provide advice to the chairman on various issues including the
   museum's relationship with the British government and policy on the
   museum's collections. Its existence was made public after a freedom of
   information request by a group campaigning against the museum's links
   with the fossil fuel industry. The museum has declined to name the
   members of the advisory group as they are acting in their personal
   capacity.^[160]

Thefts

   [edit]

   Thefts from the museum include: several historic coins and medals in
   the 1970s;^[161] a 17th-century Japanese Kakiemon figure in 1990; two
   Meiji figurines and a fragment of a gold ring in 1991; fifteen Roman
   coins and jewellery worth £250,000 in 1993; and a Japanese chest and
   two Persian books in 1996.^[162]

   In July 2002 a marble head, valued at £50,000, was stolen from the
   Archaic Greek gallery.^[163] In 2004, 15 Chinese artefacts including
   jewels, ornate hairpins and fingernail guards were stolen. In 2017, it
   was revealed that a Cartier diamond had been missing since 2011.^[161]

   In August 2023, a staff member was fired after it emerged that items
   including gold, jewellery and gems had been stolen over a "significant"
   period of time. The incident led to an investigation by the
   Metropolitan Police and an independent review by the museum.^[164] Some
   of the missing artefacts were later found to have been sold on eBay for
   considerably less than their estimated value.^[161] The museum had been
   warned of the thefts as early as 2021. The museum's director, Hartwig
   Fischer, resigned because of the museum's inadequate response to the
   warnings of theft.^[165] The number of artefacts stolen was estimated
   to be about 2,000.^[166] As a consequence of the thefts, the museum
   announced a five-year plan to digitise the complete collection and make
   it available to view online.^[167] By May 2024, 626 of the missing
   items had been recovered.^[168]

Copyright settlement

   [edit]

   In August 2023, the British Museum reached a settlement with the
   translator Yilin Wang over her translations of poetry by Qiu Jin. The
   museum had used her work without credit or permission in their
   exhibition China's Hidden Century which ran between May 2023 and
   October 2023.^[169]

Tibet naming conventions

   [edit]

   In January 2025, the British Museum was criticized by Tibetan human
   rights groups for referring to Tibet as "Xizang," the current preferred
   term of the government of the People's Republic of China.^[170]

Notes

   [edit]

    1. ^ Among the national museums in London, sculpture and decorative
       and applied art are in the Victoria and Albert Museum; the British
       Museum houses earlier art, non-Western art, prints and drawings.
       The National Gallery holds the national collection of Western
       European art to about 1900, while art of the 20th century on is at
       Tate Modern. Tate Britain holds British Art from 1500 onwards.
       Books, manuscripts and many works on paper are in the British
       Library. There are significant overlaps between the coverage of the
       various collections.
    2. ^ By the Act of Parliament it received a name – the British Museum.
       The origin of the name is not known; the word 'British' had some
       resonance nationally at this period, so soon after the Jacobite
       rebellion of 1745; it must be assumed that the museum was
       christened in this light.^[16]
    3. ^ The estimated footage of the various libraries as reported to the
       trustees has been summarised by Harris (1998), 3,6: Sloane 4,600,
       Harley 1,700, Cotton 384, Edwards 576, The Royal Library 1,890.
    4. ^ This was perhaps rather unfortunate as the title to the house was
       complicated by the fact that part of the building had been erected
       on leasehold property (the Crown lease of which ran out in 1771);
       perhaps that is why George III paid such a modest price (nominally
       £28,000) for what was to become Buckingham Palace. See Howard
       Colvin et al. (1976), 134.
    5. ^ Understanding of the foundation of the National Gallery is
       complicated by the fact that there is no documented history of the
       institution. At first the National Gallery functioned effectively
       as part of the British Museum, to which the trustees transferred
       most of their most important pictures (ex. portraits). Full control
       was handed over to the National Gallery in 1868, after the National
       Gallery Act 1856 established the gallery as an independent body.
    6. ^ Ashmole, the Keeper of the Greek and Roman Antiquities
       appreciated the original top-lighting of these galleries and
       removed the Victorian colour scheme, commenting:

     The old Elgin Gallery was painted a deep terracotta red, which,
     though in some ways satisfactory, diminished its apparent size, and
     was apt to produce a depressing effect on the visitor. It was
     decided to experiment with lighter colours, and the walls of the
     large room were painted with what was, at its first application, a
     pure cold white, but which after a year's exposure had unfortunately
     yellowed. The small Elgin Room was painted with pure white tinted
     with prussian blue, and the Room of the metopes was painted with
     pure white tinted with cobalt blue and black; it was necessary, for
     practical reasons, to colour all the dadoes a darker colour^[42]
    7. ^ Ashmole had never liked the Duveen Gallery:

     It is, I suppose, not positively bad, but it could have been
     infinitely better. It is pretentious, in that it uses the ancient
     Marbles to decorate itself. This is a long outmoded idea, and the
     exact opposite of what a sculpture gallery should do. And, although
     it incorporates them, it is out of scale, and tends to dwarf them
     with its bogus Doric features, including those columns, supporting
     almost nothing which would have made an ancient Greek artist
     architect wince. The source of daylight is too high above the
     sculptures, a fault that is only concealed by the amount of
     reflection from the pinkish marble walls. These are too similar in
     colour to the marbles... These half-dozen elementary errors were
     pointed out by everyone in the Museum, and by many scholars outside,
     when the building was projected.^[47]
       It was not until the 1980s that the installation of a lighting
       scheme removed his greatest criticism of the building.
