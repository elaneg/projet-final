   Culture of cities

   Urban culture is the culture of towns and cities. The defining theme is
   the presence of a large population in a limited space that follows
   social norms.^[1] This makes it possible for many subcultures close to
   each other, exposed to social influence without necessarily intruding
   into the private sphere.^[2] Ultimately, urban culture offers for
   diverse perspectives, more resources in the medical field, both
   physically and mentally, but it also faces challenges in maintaining
   social cohesion.

   Globally, urban areas tend to hold concentrations of power, such as
   government capitals and corporate headquarters, and the wealthy and
   powerful people that are employed in them. Cities also organize people,
   create norms, beliefs, and values.^[3]^[4] As outlined by Max Weber in
   his book, The City, "There are five things that make a city:
   fortification, market, a law code, an association of urban citizenry
   creating a sense of municipal corporateness, and sufficient political
   autonomy for urban citizens to choose the city’s governors."^[5] In
   some countries, elites have built themselves enclaves outside of the
   central city (e.g. white flight in the United States).

Political

   [edit]

   In most of the Western world, urban areas tend to be politically to the
   left of suburban and rural areas. There has always been a large
   difference in political views between these areas for a variety of
   reasons. A 2018 survey undertaken by the Pew Research Center^[6] shows
   that people who live in an urban area will most likely have political
   views that clash with someone who lives in a suburban or rural area. An
   example of this is how people in this survey felt about U.S. president
   Donald Trump. Sixty two percent of people had negative feelings on the
   president in urban areas, this number drops quite a bit when you look
   at suburban areas as only fifty one percent of people disliked the way
   the president ran things. This number hits its lowest when you look at
   rural areas as forty percent of people were negative on Trump with the
   rest being either neutral or positive. This divide on political
   subjects continues for the rest of the survey with urban areas
   preferring more progressive changes while suburban and rural areas want
   to hang on to traditions. The reason for why there is such a difference
   in opinion between these areas is a question that still doesn't have a
   solid answer. Although that has not stopped many people from trying to
   find one, this includes Cornell University professor Suzanne Mettler,
   who wrote a full article going over possible reasons for why there is
   such a difference between urban and rural voters. One reason Mettler
   came up with was the increase in the amount of jobs as she wrote "For
   decades the U.S. has experienced deindustrialization and various other
   changes in jobs and the economy, and rural areas have really suffered.
   Urban areas have adapted more effectively and created new jobs in
   technology, the service sector, and the knowledge economy. We think
   that economic deterioration has perhaps led to more resentment and
   grievance-style politics, but we’re still trying to understand that."
   Overall the difference in opinion between areas will always exist for a
   variety of reasons from education, to economic setting, and even to
   parental guidance.

Social

   [edit]

   Urban cities have grown in popularity recently due to people moving out
   of more rural ^[2] areas as time goes on. This is shown in another
   article written by the "Pew Research Center" which states "Likewise,
   recent U.S. population growth also has been uneven. Urban counties have
   grown at roughly the overall national rate of 13% since 2000. Suburban
   and small metropolitan areas have grown more briskly. Rural counties
   have lagged, and half of them have fewer residents now than they did in
   2000".^[3] This trend has been happening for a variety of reasons, such
   as the increase of migrants, a rise in birth rate and a drop off in
   death rate, and people preferring the bustling city life of an urban
   area over more quiet and isolated rural areas.

   Urban areas are able to provide things that rural and suburban areas
   either cannot, such as regular public transportation, a varied ethnic
   pool to make meeting new people an easy process, more jobs available,
   and the ease of which you are able to reach stores or entertainment
   areas such as clubs and bars. These points are far more relevant when
   you consider the ages of people who live in urban areas compared to
   anywhere else. The median age of rural areas is 43 years old while the
   average for urban areas is 36. Younger people are more likely to go
   looking for jobs in the city because it would be far easier to look for
   a job in a densely populated area rather than on the countryside where
   everything is spaced out. Transportation is also a more simple process
   for the younger generation as simply taking a bus to school or work can
   be easier for a young adult than buying a car and managing all the
   expenses that can come with that. Finally with entertainment areas
   being so close together younger people are able to have a night out
   instead of having to drive a large distance to clubs and bars; an issue
   that is prevalent in rural areas due to being located in the country.

   Pope Francis acknowledges, however, the potential for city life to be a
   chaotic existence.^[7]

By country

Canada

   Urban culture is a huge part of Canada as 81.65%^[8] of Canada's
   inhabitants live in cities. The urbanization of Canada has been decades
   in the making starting back in the 19th century. From 1871 to 1911 the
   population of Canada would double from 3.6 million to 7.2 million. Most
   of this growth can be attributed thanks to urban cities expanding in
   order to allow more people to live there. Author John Douglas Belshaw
   wrote a book about the history of Canada and went into detail about the
   rise of urban culture in Canada when he wrote "Most of that growth was
   in urban areas as the share of the workforce engaged in
   non-agricultural pursuits rose from 51.9% to over 60% in the same
   period. [2] Even in Nova Scotia, where the benefits of
   industrialization were not long lasting nor very deep, the impact on
   the scale of urban settlements was very dramatic: in the decade after
   Confederation, Halifax grew by 22%, New Glasgow by 55%, Sydney Mines by
   57%, and Truro by 64%." By the 1890s industrialization was taking
   effect in Canada with the production of machinery and the increasing
   use of things such as oil and coal which was boosting the population of
   places such as Toronto and Edmonton rapidly. Urbanization would
   continue into the 20th century with Canadians and immigrants moving
   from city to city for work due to the now dense population and job
   openings that come from that. It wasn't all well and good however as
   due to the increasing population things would become crowded and harder
   to accommodate every single city and their needs. This means that
   lesser cities would be run down with water systems that would not work
   and houses that were shabbily built in order to quickly prepare for the
   spike of people living in the city. As we move in the modern era these
   issues aren't as prevalent in Canada but there are still underdeveloped
   cities and people flocking to find some sort of work in an extremely
   competitive urban environment.

   Urban culture is also sometimes used as a euphemism for the culture of
   visible minorities (non-Whites). Sometimes this means Black Canadian
   culture, this connection is much less apparent than somewhere like the
   U.S. due to blacks only making up 3% of the total population. More
   generally, the phrase may be used to connote the multicultural,
   immigrant-friendly mosaic atmosphere cultivated by cities such as
   Toronto, Vancouver, and British Columbia.

United States

   [edit]
   Main articles: Great Migration (African American) and Second Great
   Migration (African American)

   In the United States, Urban culture has been used as a euphemistic
   reference to contemporary African American culture.^[9]
   [250px-Bronxhub1.jpeg] The Hub is the retail heart of the South Bronx,
   New York City. Between 1900 and 1930, the number of Bronx residents
   increased from 201,000 to 1,265,000.^[10]

   Prior to the 20th century, the African American population was
   primarily rural. The Great Migration of African-Americans created the
   first large, urban black communities in the American North. It is
   conservatively estimated that 400,000 left the South during the
   two-year period of 1916–1918 to take advantage of a labor shortage
   created in the wake of the First World War.^[11] The 20th century
   cultures of many of the United States' modern cities were forged in
   this period.

   In 1910, the African American population of Detroit was 6,000. By the
   start of the Great Depression in 1929, this figure had risen to
   120,000.

   In 1900 Chicago had a total population of 1,698,575.^[12] By 1920 the
   population had increased by more than 1 million residents. During the
   second wave of the Great Migration (from 1940 to 1960), the African
   American population in the city grew from 278,000 to 813,000. The South
   Side of Chicago was considered the black capital of America.^[13]

   The massive number of African Americans to Ohio, in particularly to
   Cleveland, greatly changed the demographics of the state and Cleveland.
   Prior to the Great Migration, an estimated 1.1 - 1.6% of Cleveland's
   population was African American.^[14] In 1920, 4.3% of Cleveland's
   population was African American.^[14] The number of African Americans
   in Cleveland continued to rise over the next twenty years of the Great
   Migration. Other cities, such as St. Louis, Baltimore, Philadelphia and
   New York City, also experienced surges in their African-American
   populations.

   In the South, the departure of hundreds of thousands of African
   Americans caused the black percentage of the population in most
   Southern states to decrease. For example, in Mississippi, blacks
   decreased from about 56% of the population in 1910 to about 37% by
   1970^[15] and in South Carolina, blacks decreased from about 55% of the
   population in 1910 to about 30% by 1970.^[15]

   By the end of the Second Great Migration, African Americans had become
   an urbanized population. More than 80 percent lived in cities.
   Fifty-three percent remained in the Southern United States, while 40
   percent lived in the Northeast and North Central states and 7 percent
   in the West.^[16]
