   writing

   Culture (/ˈkʌltʃər/ KUL-chər) is a concept that encompasses the social
   behavior, institutions, and norms found in human societies, as well as
   the knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities, attitudes,
   and habits of the individuals in these groups.^[1] Culture often
   originates from or is attributed to a specific region or location.

   Humans acquire culture through the learning processes of enculturation
   and socialization, which is shown by the diversity of cultures across
   societies. A cultural norm codifies acceptable conduct in society; it
   serves as a guideline for behavior, dress, language, and demeanor in a
   situation, which serves as a template for expectations in a social
   group. Accepting only a monoculture in a social group can bear risks,
   just as a single species can wither in the face of environmental
   change, for lack of functional responses to the change.^[2] Thus in
   military culture, valor is counted as a typical behavior for an
   individual, and duty, honor, and loyalty to the social group are
   counted as virtues or functional responses in the continuum of
   conflict. In religion, analogous attributes can be identified in a
   social group.

   Cultural change, or repositioning, is the reconstruction of a cultural
   concept of a society. Cultures are internally affected by both forces
   encouraging change and forces resisting change. Cultures are externally
   affected via contact between societies. Organizations like UNESCO
   attempt to preserve culture and cultural heritage.

Description

   [250px-Africa_Speaks%21_%281930%29_-_Pygmy_Drummers.jpg] Pygmy music
   has been polyphonic well before their discovery by non-African
   explorers of the Baka, Aka, Efe, and other foragers of the Central
   African forests, in the 1200s, which is at least 200 years before
   polyphony developed in Europe. Note the multiple lines of singers and
   dancers. The motifs are independent, with theme and variation
   interweaving.^[3] This type of music is thought to be the first
   expression of polyphony in world music.

   Culture is considered a central concept in anthropology, encompassing
   the range of phenomena that are transmitted through social learning in
   human societies. Cultural universals are found in all human societies.
   These include expressive forms like art, music, dance, ritual,
   religion, and technologies like tool usage, cooking, shelter, and
   clothing. The concept of material culture covers the physical
   expressions of culture, such as technology, architecture and art,
   whereas the immaterial aspects of culture such as principles of social
   organization (including practices of political organization and social
   institutions), mythology, philosophy, literature (both written and
   oral), and science comprise the intangible cultural heritage of a
   society.^[4]

   In the humanities, one sense of culture as an attribute of the
   individual has been the degree to which they have cultivated a
   particular level of sophistication in the arts, sciences, education, or
   manners.^[5] The level of cultural sophistication has also sometimes
   been used to distinguish civilizations from less complex societies.^[6]
   Such hierarchical perspectives on culture are also found in class-based
   distinctions between a high culture of the social elite and a low
   culture, popular culture, or folk culture of the lower classes,
   distinguished by stratified access to cultural capital.^[7] In common
   parlance, culture is often used to refer specifically to the symbolic
   markers used by ethnic groups to distinguish themselves visibly from
   each other, such as body modification, clothing or jewelry.^[8] Mass
   culture refers to the mass-produced and mass-mediated forms of consumer
   culture that emerged in the 20th century.^[9] Some schools of
   philosophy, such as Marxism and critical theory, have argued that
   culture is often used politically as a tool of the elites to manipulate
   the proletariat and create a false consciousness.^[10] Such
   perspectives are common in the discipline of cultural studies.^[11] In
   the wider social sciences, the theoretical perspective of cultural
   materialism holds that human symbolic culture arises from the material
   conditions of human life, and that the basis of culture is found in
   evolved biological dispositions.^[12]

   When used as a count noun, a "culture" is the set of customs,
   traditions, and values of a society or community, such as an ethnic
   group or nation, and the knowledge acquired over time.^[13] In this
   sense, multiculturalism values the peaceful coexistence and mutual
   respect between different cultures inhabiting the same planet.^[14]
   Sometimes "culture" is also used to describe specific practices within
   a subgroup of a society, a subculture (e.g., "bro culture"), or a
   counterculture.^[15] Within cultural anthropology, the ideology and
   analytical stance of cultural relativism hold that cultures cannot
   easily be objectively ranked or evaluated because any evaluation is
   necessarily situated within the value system of a given culture.^[16]

Etymology

   The modern term culture is based on a term used by the ancient Roman
   orator Cicero in his Tusculanae Disputationes, where he wrote of a
   cultivation of the soul or cultura animi,^[17] using an agricultural
   metaphor for the development of a philosophical soul, understood
   teleologically as the highest possible ideal for human development.
   Samuel von Pufendorf took over this metaphor in a modern context,
   meaning something similar, but no longer assuming philosophy was
   humanity's natural perfection. This use, and that of many writers,
   "refers to all the ways in which human beings overcome their original
   barbarism, and through artifice, become fully human".^[18]

   Edward S. Casey wrote, "The very word culture meant 'place tilled' in
   Middle English, and the same word goes back to Latin colere, 'to
   inhabit, care for, till, worship' and cultus, 'A cult, especially a
   religious one.' To be cultural, to have a culture, is to inhabit a
   place sufficiently intensely to cultivate it—to be responsible for it,
   to respond to it, to attend to it caringly."^[19]

   Culture described by Richard Velkley:^[18]

     ... originally meant the cultivation of the soul or mind, acquires
     most of its later modern meaning in the writings of the 18th-century
     German thinkers, who were on various levels developing Rousseau's
     criticism of "modern liberalism and Enlightenment". Thus a contrast
     between "culture" and "civilization" is usually implied in these
     authors, even when not expressed as such.

   In the words of anthropologist E. B. Tylor, it is "that complex whole
   which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any
   other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of
   society".^[20] Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, "Culture is
   defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses
   and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities
   and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.^[21]

   The Cambridge English Dictionary states that culture is "the way of
   life, especially the general customs and beliefs, of a particular group
   of people at a particular time."^[22] Terror management theory posits
   that culture is a series of activities and worldviews that provide
   humans with the basis for perceiving themselves as "person[s] of worth
   within the world of meaning"—raising themselves above the merely
   physical aspects of existence, in order to deny the animal
   insignificance and death that Homo sapiens became aware of when they
   acquired a larger brain.^[23]^[24]

   The word is used in a general sense as the evolved ability to
   categorize and represent experiences with symbols and to act
   imaginatively and creatively.^[25] This ability arose with the
   evolution of behavioral modernity in humans around 50,000 years ago and
   is often thought to be unique to humans.^[26] However, some other
   species have demonstrated similar, though less complicated, abilities
   for social learning.^[27] It is also used to denote the complex
   networks of practices and accumulated knowledge and ideas that are
   transmitted through social interaction and exist in specific human
   groups, or cultures, using the plural form.^[28]

Change

   Main article: Culture change
   [250px-Beatles_ad_1965_just_the_beatles_crop.jpg] The Beatles
   exemplified changing cultural dynamics, not only in music, but fashion
   and lifestyle. Six decades after their emergence, they continue to have
   a worldwide cultural impact.

   Raimon Panikkar identified 29 ways in which cultural change can be
   brought about, including growth, development, evolution, involution,
   renovation, reconception, reform, innovation, revivalism, revolution,
   mutation, progress, diffusion, osmosis, borrowing, eclecticism,
   syncretism, modernization, indigenization, and transformation.^[29] In
   this context, modernization could be viewed as adopting
   Enlightenment-era beliefs and practices, such as science, rationalism,
   industry, commerce, democracy, and the notion of progress. Rein Raud,
   building on the work of Umberto Eco, Pierre Bourdieu and Jeffrey C.
   Alexander, has proposed a model of cultural change based on claims and
   bids, which are judged by their cognitive adequacy and endorsed or not
   endorsed by the symbolic authority of the cultural community in
   question.^[30]

   Cultural invention has come to mean any innovation that is new and
   found to be useful to a group of people and expressed in their
   behavior, but which does not exist as a physical object. Humanity is in
   a global "accelerating culture change period," driven by the expansion
   of international commerce, the mass media, and above all, the human
   population explosion, among other factors. Culture repositioning means
   the reconstruction of the cultural concept of a society.^[31]

   Cultures are internally affected by both forces encouraging change and
   forces resisting change. These forces are related to both social
   structures and natural events and are involved in perpetuating cultural
   ideas and practices within current structures, which themselves are
   subject to change.^[32]

   Social conflict and the development of technologies can produce changes
   within a society by altering social dynamics and promoting new cultural
   models and spurring or enabling generative action. These social shifts
   may accompany ideological shifts and other types of cultural change.
   For example, the feminist movement involved new practices that produced
   a shift in gender relations, altering both gender and economic
   structures. Environmental conditions may also enter as factors. For
   example, after tropical forests returned at the end of the last ice
   age, plants suitable for domestication were available, leading to the
   invention of agriculture, which in turn brought about many cultural
   innovations and shifts in social dynamics.^[33]

   Sense of time is dependent on culture. This is a 1913 photo, but it can
   be difficult to date for a viewer, due to the absence of cultural cues.

   Cultures are externally affected via contact between societies, which
   may also produce—or inhibit—social shifts and changes in cultural
   practices. War or competition over resources may impact technological
   development or social dynamics. Additionally, cultural ideas may
   transfer from one society to another, through diffusion or
   acculturation. In diffusion, the form of something (though not
   necessarily its meaning) moves from one culture to another. For
   example, Western restaurant chains and culinary brands sparked
   curiosity and fascination to the Chinese as China opened its economy to
   international trade in the late 20th-century.^[34] "Stimulus diffusion"
   (the sharing of ideas) refers to an element of one culture leading to
   an invention or propagation in another. "Direct borrowing", on the
   other hand, tends to refer to technological or tangible diffusion from
   one culture to another. Diffusion of innovations theory presents a
   research-based model of why and when individuals and cultures adopt new
   ideas, practices, and products.^[35]

   Acculturation has different meanings. Still, in this context, it refers
   to the replacement of traits of one culture with another, such as what
   happened to certain Native American tribes and many indigenous peoples
   across the globe during colonization. Related processes on an
   individual level include assimilation and transculturation. The
   transnational flow of culture has played a major role in merging
   different cultures and sharing thoughts, ideas, and beliefs.

Early modern discourses

German Romanticism

   [250px-Johann_gottfried_herder.jpg] Johann Herder called attention to
   national cultures.

   Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) formulated an individualist definition of
   "enlightenment" similar to the concept of bildung: "Enlightenment is
   man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity."^[36] He argued that
   this immaturity comes not from a lack of understanding, but from a lack
   of courage to think independently. Against this intellectual cowardice,
   Kant urged: "Sapere Aude" ("Dare to be wise!"). In reaction to Kant,
   German scholars such as Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) argued that
   human creativity, which necessarily takes unpredictable and highly
   diverse forms, is as important as human rationality. Moreover, Herder
   proposed a collective form of Bildung: "For Herder, Bildung was the
   totality of experiences that provide a coherent identity, and sense of
   common destiny, to a people."^[37]
   [250px-Adolf_Bastian.jpg] Adolf Bastian developed a universal model of
   culture.

   In 1795, the Prussian linguist and philosopher Wilhelm von Humboldt
   (1767–1835) called for an anthropology that would synthesize Kant's and
   Herder's interests. During the Romantic era, scholars in Germany,
   especially those concerned with nationalist movements—such as the
   nationalist struggle to create a "Germany" out of diverse
   principalities, and the nationalist struggles by ethnic minorities
   against the Austro-Hungarian Empire—developed a more inclusive notion
   of culture as "worldview" (Weltanschauung).^[38] According to this
   school of thought, each ethnic group has a distinct worldview that is
   incommensurable with the worldviews of other groups. Although more
   inclusive than earlier views, this approach to culture still allowed
   for distinctions between "civilized" and "primitive" or "tribal"
   cultures.

   In 1860, Adolf Bastian (1826–1905) argued for "the psychic unity of
   mankind".^[39] He proposed that a scientific comparison of all human
   societies would reveal that distinct worldviews consisted of the same
   basic elements. According to Bastian, all human societies share a set
   of "elementary ideas" (Elementargedanken); different cultures, or
   different "folk ideas" (Völkergedanken), are local modifications of the
   elementary ideas.^[40] This view paved the way for the modern
   understanding of culture. Franz Boas (1858–1942) was trained in this
   tradition, and he brought it with him when he left Germany for the
   United States.^[41]

English Romanticism

   [250px-Matthew_Arnold_-_Project_Gutenberg_eText_16745.jpg] British poet
   and critic Matthew Arnold viewed "culture" as the cultivation of the
   humanist ideal.

   In the 19th century, humanists such as English poet and essayist
   Matthew Arnold (1822–1888) used the word "culture" to refer to an ideal
   of individual human refinement, of "the best that has been thought and
   said in the world".^[42] This concept of culture is also comparable to
   the German concept of bildung: "...culture being a pursuit of our total
   perfection by means of getting to know, on all the matters which most
   concern us, the best which has been thought and said in the
   world".^[42]

   In practice, culture referred to an elite ideal and was associated with
   such activities as art, classical music, and haute cuisine.^[43] As
   these forms were associated with urban life, "culture" was identified
   with "civilization" (from Latin: civitas, lit. 'city'). Another facet
   of the Romantic movement was an interest in folklore, which led to
   identifying a "culture" among non-elites. This distinction is often
   characterized as that between high culture, namely that of the ruling
   class, and low culture. In other words, the idea of "culture" that
   developed in Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries reflected
   inequalities within European societies.^[44]
   [250px-Edward_Burnett_Tylor.jpg] British anthropologist Edward Tylor
   was one of the first English-speaking scholars to use the term culture
   in an inclusive and universal sense.

   Matthew Arnold contrasted "culture" with anarchy; other Europeans,
   following philosophers Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau,
   contrasted "culture" with "the state of nature". According to Hobbes
   and Rousseau, the Native Americans who were being conquered by
   Europeans from the 16th centuries on were living in a state of nature;
   this opposition was expressed through the contrast between "civilized"
   and "uncivilized".^[45] According to this way of thinking, one could
   classify some countries and nations as more civilized than others and
   some people as more cultured than others. This contrast led to Herbert
   Spencer's theory of Social Darwinism and Lewis Henry Morgan's theory of
   cultural evolution. Just as some critics have argued that the
   distinction between high and low cultures expresses the conflict
   between European elites and non-elites, other critics have argued that
   the distinction between civilized and uncivilized people is an
   expression of the conflict between European colonial powers and their
   colonial subjects.

   Other 19th-century critics, following Rousseau, have accepted this
   differentiation between higher and lower culture, but have seen the
   refinement and sophistication of high culture as corrupting and
   unnatural developments that obscure and distort people's essential
   nature. These critics considered folk music (as produced by "the folk,"
   i.e., rural, illiterate, peasants) to honestly express a natural way of
   life, while classical music seemed superficial and decadent. Equally,
   this view often portrayed indigenous peoples as "noble savages" living
   authentic and unblemished lives, uncomplicated and uncorrupted by the
   highly stratified capitalist systems of Western culture.

   In 1870 the anthropologist Edward Tylor (1832–1917) applied these ideas
   of higher versus lower culture to propose a theory of the evolution of
   religion. According to this theory, religion evolves from more
   polytheistic to more monotheistic forms.^[46] In the process, he
   redefined culture as a diverse set of activities characteristic of all
   human societies. This view paved the way for the modern understanding
   of religion.

   Although anthropologists worldwide refer to Tylor's definition of
   culture,^[47] in the 20th century "culture" emerged as the central and
   unifying concept of American anthropology, where it most commonly
   refers to the universal human capacity to classify and encode human
   experiences symbolically, and to communicate symbolically encoded
   experiences socially.^[48] American anthropology is organized into four
   fields, each of which plays an important role in research on culture:
   biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology, cultural
   anthropology, and in the United States and Canada,
   archaeology.^[49]^[50]^[51]^[52] The term Kulturbrille, or 'culture
   glasses', coined by German American anthropologist Franz Boas, refers
   to the "lenses" through which a person sees their own culture. Martin
   Lindstrom asserts that Kulturbrille, which allow a person to make sense
   of the culture they inhabit, "can blind us to things outsiders pick up
   immediately".^[53]

Sociology

   Main article: Sociology of culture
   [250px-04162012Bailes032.JPG] An example of folkloric dancing in
   Colombia

   The sociology of culture concerns culture as manifested in society. For
   sociologist Georg Simmel (1858–1918), culture referred to "the
   cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which
   have been objectified in the course of history".^[54] As such, culture
   in the sociological field can be defined as the ways of thinking, the
   ways of acting, and the material objects that together shape a people's
   way of life. Culture can be either of two types, non-material culture
   or material culture.^[4] Non-material culture refers to the
   non-physical ideas that individuals have about their culture, including
   values, belief systems, rules, norms, morals, language, organizations,
   and institutions, while material culture is the physical evidence of a
   culture in the objects and architecture they make or have made. The
   term tends to be relevant only in archeological and anthropological
   studies, but it specifically means all material evidence which can be
   attributed to culture, past or present.

   Cultural sociology first emerged in Weimar Germany (1918–1933), where
   sociologists such as Alfred Weber used the term Kultursoziologie
   ('cultural sociology'). Cultural sociology was then reinvented in the
   English-speaking world as a product of the cultural turn of the 1960s,
   which ushered in structuralist and postmodern approaches to social
   science. This type of cultural sociology may be loosely regarded as an
   approach incorporating cultural analysis and critical theory. Cultural
   sociologists tend to reject scientific methods, instead hermeneutically
   focusing on words, artifacts and symbols. Culture has since become an
   important concept across many branches of sociology, including
   resolutely scientific fields like social stratification and social
   network analysis. As a result, there has been a recent influx of
   quantitative sociologists to the field. Thus, there is now a growing
   group of sociologists of culture who are, confusingly, not cultural
   sociologists. These scholars reject the abstracted postmodern aspects
   of cultural sociology, and instead, look for a theoretical backing in
   the more scientific vein of social psychology and cognitive
   science.^[55]

   culture that is celebrated by people in more than 22 countries with

   celebrated by diverse communities for over 7,000 years.

Early researchers and development of cultural sociology

   The sociology of culture grew from the intersection between sociology
   (as shaped by early theorists like Marx,^[56] Durkheim, and Weber) with
   the growing discipline of anthropology, wherein researchers pioneered
   ethnographic strategies for describing and analyzing a variety of
   cultures around the world. Part of the legacy of the early development
   of the field lingers in the methods (much of cultural, sociological
   research is qualitative), in the theories (a variety of critical
   approaches to sociology are central to current research communities),
   and in the substantive focus of the field. For instance, relationships
   between popular culture, political control, and social class were early
   and lasting concerns in the field.

Cultural studies

   Main article: Cultural studies

   In the United Kingdom, sociologists and other scholars influenced by
   Marxism such as Stuart Hall (1932–2014) and Raymond Williams (1921–88)
   developed cultural studies. Following nineteenth-century Romantics,
   they identified culture with consumption goods and leisure activities
   (such as art, music, film, food, sports, and clothing). They saw
   patterns of consumption and leisure as determined by relations of
   production, which led them to focus on class relations and the
   organization of production.^[57]^[58]

   In the UK, cultural studies focuses largely on the study of popular
   culture; that is, on the social meanings of mass-produced consumer and
   leisure goods. Richard Hoggart coined the term in 1964 when he founded
   the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies or CCCS.^[59] Cultural
   studies in this sense, then, can be viewed as a limited concentration
   scoped on the intricacies of consumerism, which belongs to a wider
   culture sometimes referred to as Western civilization or globalism.
   [250px-Metropolitan_Museum_1_%284675714481%29.jpg] The Metropolitan
   Museum of Art in Manhattan. Visual art can be one expression of high
   culture.

   From the 1970s onward, Stuart Hall's pioneering work, along with that
   of his colleagues Paul Willis, Dick Hebdige, Tony Jefferson, and Angela
   McRobbie, created an international intellectual movement. As the field
   developed, it began to combine political economy, communication,
   sociology, social theory, literary theory, media theory, film/video
   studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy, museum studies, and art
   history to study cultural phenomena or cultural texts. In this field
   researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to
   matters of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, or
   gender.^[60]

   Cultural studies is concerned with the meaning and practices of
   everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular
   things (such as watching television or eating out) in a given culture.
   It also studies the meanings and uses people attribute to various
   objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings
   and practices held independently of reason. Watching television to view
   a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as
   culture unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may
   have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching
   television after school with their friends to "fit in" certainly
   qualifies since there is no grounded reason for one's participation in
   this practice.

   In the context of cultural studies, a text includes not only written
   language, but also films, photographs, fashion, or hairstyles: the
   texts of cultural studies comprise all the meaningful artifacts of
   culture.^[61] Similarly, the discipline widens the concept of culture.
   Culture, for a cultural-studies researcher, not only includes
   traditional high culture (the culture of the ruling social groups)^[62]
   and popular culture, but also everyday meanings and practices. The last
   two, in fact, have become the main focus of cultural studies. A further
   and recent approach is comparative cultural studies, based on the
   disciplines of comparative literature and cultural studies.^[63]

   Scholars in the UK and the US developed different versions of cultural
   studies after the 1970s. The British version of cultural studies had
   originated in the 1950s and 60s, mainly under the influence of Richard
   Hoggart, E. P. Thompson, and Raymond Williams, and later that of Stuart
   Hall and others at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies. This
   included overtly political, left-wing views, and criticisms of popular
   culture as "capitalist" mass culture; it absorbed some of the ideas of
   the Frankfurt School critique of the "culture industry" i.e. mass
   culture. This emerges in the writings of early British cultural-studies
   scholars and their influences: see the work of Raymond Williams, Stuart
   Hall, Paul Willis, and Paul Gilroy.

   In the United States, Lindlof and Taylor write, "cultural studies
   [were] grounded in a pragmatic, liberal-pluralist tradition."^[64] The
   American version of cultural studies initially concerned itself more
   with understanding the subjective and appropriative side of audience
   reactions to, and uses of, mass culture; for example, American
   cultural-studies advocates wrote about the liberatory aspects of
   fandom.^[65]^[66]

   Some researchers, especially in early British cultural studies, apply a
   Marxist model to the field. This strain of thinking has some influence
   from the Frankfurt School, but especially from the structuralist
   Marxism of Louis Althusser and others. The main focus of an orthodox
   Marxist approach concentrates on the production of meaning. This model
   assumes a mass production of culture and identifies power as residing
   with those producing cultural artifacts.

   In a Marxist view, the mode and relations of production form the
   economic base of society, which constantly interacts and influences
   superstructures, such as culture.^[67] Other approaches to cultural
   studies, such as feminist cultural studies and later American
   developments of the field, distance themselves from this view. They
   criticize the Marxist assumption of a single, dominant meaning, shared
   by all, for any cultural product. The non-Marxist approaches suggest
   that different ways of consuming cultural artifacts affect the meaning
   of the product.

   This view comes through in the book Doing Cultural Studies: The Story
   of the Sony Walkman (by Paul du Gay et al.),^[68] which seeks to
   challenge the notion that those who produce commodities control the
   meanings that people attribute to them. Feminist cultural analyst,
   theorist, and art historian Griselda Pollock contributed to cultural
   studies from viewpoints of art history and psychoanalysis. The writer
   Julia Kristeva is among influential voices at the turn of the century,
   contributing to cultural studies from the field of art and
   psychoanalytical French feminism.^[69]

   Petrakis and Kostis (2013) divide cultural background variables into
   two main groups:^[70]
    1. The first group covers the variables that represent the "efficiency
       orientation" of the societies: performance orientation, future
       orientation, assertiveness, power distance, and uncertainty
       avoidance.
    2. The second covers the variables that represent the "social
       orientation" of societies, i.e., the attitudes and lifestyles of
       their members. These variables include gender egalitarianism,
       institutional collectivism, in-group collectivism, and human
       orientation.

   In 2016, a new approach to culture was suggested by Rein Raud,^[30] who
   defines culture as the sum of resources available to human beings for
   making sense of their world and proposes a two-tiered approach,
   combining the study of texts (all reified meanings in circulation) and
   cultural practices (all repeatable actions that involve the production,
   dissemination or transmission of purposes), thus making it possible to
   re-link anthropological and sociological study of culture with the
   tradition of textual theory.

Super culture

   A super culture is a collection of cultures and subcultures, that
   interact with one another, share similar characteristics and
   collectively have a degree of sense of unity.^[citation needed] In
   other words, Super-culture is a culture encompassing several
   subcultures with common elements.^[71] Examples include: List of
   Super-cultures:
     * Rave - In modern society, rave is described as a culture closely
       defined as a super culture.^[72]^[73]
     * Steampunk - it is fast becoming a super-culture rather than a mere
       subculture.^[74]
     * Foodtruck collectives & Pop-up Restaurants + Shops.

   Some ancient cultures that are also considered (termed)
   "Super-culture":
     * Megalithic Super-culture in Prehistoric Europe
     * Asian Super-culture (See Korean nationalist historiography)

   Cognitive tools suggest a way for people from certain culture to deal
   with real-life problems, like Suanpan for mathematical calculation.

   Starting in the 1990s,^[75]^: 31  psychological research on culture
   influence began to grow and challenge the universality assumed in
   general psychology.^[76]^: 158–168 ^[77] Culture psychologists began to
   try to explore the relationship between emotions and culture, and
   answer whether the human mind is independent from culture. For example,
   people from collectivistic cultures, such as the Japanese, suppress
   their positive emotions more than their American counterparts.^[78]
   Culture may affect the way that people experience and express emotions.
   On the other hand, some researchers try to look for differences between
   people's personalities across cultures.^[79]^[80] As different cultures
   dictate distinctive norms, culture shock is also studied to understand
   how people react when they are confronted with other cultures. LGBT
   culture is displayed with significantly different levels of tolerance
   within different cultures and nations. Cognitive tools may not be
   accessible or they may function differently cross culture.^[75]^: 19 
   For example, people who are raised in a culture with an abacus are
   trained with distinctive reasoning style.^[81] Cultural lenses may also
   make people view the same outcome of events differently. Westerners are
   more motivated by their successes than their failures, while East
   Asians are better motivated by the avoidance of failure.^[82]

   Culture is important for psychologists to consider when understanding
   the human mental operation. The notion of the anxious, unstable, and
   rebellious adolescent has been criticized by experts, such as Robert
   Epstein, who state that an undeveloped brain is not the main cause of
   teenagers' turmoils.^[83]^[84] Some have criticized this understanding
   of adolescence, classifying it as a relatively recent phenomenon in
   human history created by modern society,^[85]^[86]^[87]^[88] and have
   been highly critical of what they view as the infantilization of young
   adults in American society.^[89] According to Robert Epstein and
   Jennifer, "American-style teen turmoil is absent in more than 100
   cultures around the world, suggesting that such mayhem is not
   biologically inevitable. Second, the brain itself changes in response
   to experiences, raising the question of whether adolescent brain
   characteristics are the cause of teen tumult or rather the result of
   lifestyle and experiences."^[90] David Moshman has also stated in
   regards to adolescence that brain research "is crucial for a full
   picture, but it does not provide an ultimate explanation".^[91]

Protection of culture

   [250px-Restauration_cercueil-egyptien_Mbalyon_%2812%29.jpg] Restoration
   of an ancient Egyptian monument

   There are a number of international agreements and national laws
   relating to the protection of cultural heritage and cultural diversity.
   UNESCO and its partner organizations such as Blue Shield International
   coordinate international protection and local implementation.^[92]^[93]
   The Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the
   Event of Armed Conflict and the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and
   Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions deal with the
   protection of culture. Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human
   Rights deals with cultural heritage in two ways: it gives people the
   right to participate in cultural life on the one hand and the right to
   the protection of their contributions to cultural life on the
   other.^[94]

   In the 21st century, the protection of culture has been the focus of
   increasing activity by national and international organizations. The
   United Nations and UNESCO promote cultural preservation and cultural
   diversity through declarations and legally-binding conventions or
   treaties. The aim is not to protect a person's property, but rather to
   preserve the cultural heritage of humanity, especially in the event of
   war and armed conflict. According to Karl von Habsburg, President of
   Blue Shield International, the destruction of cultural assets is also
   part of psychological warfare. The target of the attack is the identity
   of the opponent, which is why symbolic cultural assets become a main
   target. It is also intended to affect the particularly sensitive
   cultural memory, the growing cultural diversity and the economic basis
   (such as tourism) of a state, region or municipality.^[95]^[96]^[97]

   Tourism is having an increasing impact on the various forms of culture.
   On the one hand, this can be physical impact on individual objects or
   the destruction caused by increasing environmental pollution and, on
   the other hand, socio-cultural effects on society.^[98]^[99]^[100]
