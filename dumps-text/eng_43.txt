Heritage, Culture and Creativity (HCC) Programme

   Topics:
     * Arts and culture,
     * Arts

   On 3 July 2024 Minister Lyons announced a new approach to provide, for
   the first time, a comprehensive collection of culture-related policies
   in Northern Ireland. Under the heading of “Heritage, Culture and
   Creativity”, this programme will address actions to conserve, protect
   and promote our cultural heritage and historic environment; and to
   encourage, support and develop the curiosity, active engagement and
   creativity it helps to inspire particularly through the arts.

Benefits of HCC approach

   Heritage, Culture and Creativity will not only build on the important
   work undertaken by the Culture, Arts and Heritage Taskforce but its
   focus will be expanded to include the review and refreshment of
   policies on public libraries and of museums.

   The structure of the programme gives each of the constituent parts the
   status they merit; provide each of the communities of interest their
   own focus; and allow each exercise to proceed on its own timetable.
   Heritage, Culture and Creativity will deliver distinct policies for the
   Department’s responsibilities in respect of heritage, arts, museums and
   public libraries. Given the many common themes running through the
   work, these will be brought together again through a collated
   action-planning model.

HCC Programme Framework

   A year since the launch of the HCC Programme, the Minister has
   published the Heritage, Culture and Creativity Framework.

   The framework outlines the context, purpose and direction of the HCC
   Programme and includes draft policy aims for arts, museums, public
   libraries and the historic environment.

   It is informed by the completion of a series of engagements with all
   the Executive departments, district councils and the relevant
   arm’s-length bodies and builds on the engagement and the work
   undertaken by the Culture, Arts and Heritage Taskforce.

   The Framework also sets the scene for the public consultation phase of
   the policy-making process by including early sight of draft policy aims
   and an outline of some emerging programme-level actions.

Culture, Arts and Heritage – A Way Forward

   In October 2022, the then Minister for Communities, Deirdre Hargey,
   launched a programme of work to develop a new vision and strategy for
   culture, arts and heritage.

   The approach was outlined in a Way Forward document which aimed to
   shape better ways for the culture, arts and heritage sectors to be more
   fully recognised, harnessed and supported as key enablers of a thriving
   society.

Building on the work of stakeholders

   This process advanced the recommendations of stakeholders who had
   shaped emergency responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, and who called for
   a longer-term strategy to support recovery.

The CAH Strategy Taskforce

   The reconvened Taskforce brought together stakeholders from across the
   Culture, Arts and Heritage sectors who mapped out their proposals a
   sectoral development and investment report to reorientate how the
   culture, arts and heritage sectors are collectively perceived, engaged
   and supported across government.

   The work of the Taskforce concluded with the presentation of the
   report, ‘Investing in Creative Delivery,’ to the Department.
