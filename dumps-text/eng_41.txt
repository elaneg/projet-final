            that by 2030 we want England to be a country in which the
            creativity of each of us is valued and given the chance to
            flourish and where everyone of us has access to a remarkable
            range of high quality cultural experiences. We invest public
            money from Government and The National Lottery to help support

   (BUTTON)

OUR DEFINITION OF CULTURE

   ‘Culture’ means many things to many people and is often used to refer
   to food, religion and other forms of heritage. Here, though, we use it
   to mean all those areas of activity associated with the artforms and
   organisations in which Arts Council England invests: collections,
   combined arts, dance, libraries, literature, museums, music, theatre
   and the visual arts. By describing all of this work collectively as
   ‘culture’, rather than separately as ‘the arts’, ‘museums’ and
   ‘libraries’, we aim to be inclusive of the full breadth of activity
   that we support, as well as to reflect findings from the research we
   commissioned for this Strategy, which showed that members of the public
   tend to use the words ‘the arts’ and ‘artists’ to refer specifically to
   classical music, opera, ballet or the fine arts. Similarly, we have
   used ‘creative practitioners’ rather than ‘artists’ as an umbrella term
   for all those who work to create new, or reshape existing,
   cultural content.



OUR DEFINITION OF CREATIVITY

   ‘Creativity’ describes the process through which people apply their
   knowledge, skill and intuition to imagine, conceive, express or make
   something that wasn’t there before. While creativity is present in all
   areas of life, in this Strategy, we use it specifically to refer to the
   process of making, producing or participating in ‘culture’. We also
   recognise that the traditional boundaries between and around cultural
   activities are disappearing as new technologies and other societal
   changes alter the ways in which many artists, curators, librarians and
   other practitioners work, as well as how culture is made and shared.
   We’re excited by these changes, which we expect to accelerate over the
   next decade – and in response, we will become more flexible about the
   range and type of cultural activities that we support over the years
   to come.

BY 2030, WE WANT ENGLAND TO BE A COUNTRY IN WHICH THE CREATIVITY OF EACH OF
US IS VALUED AND GIVEN THE CHANCE TO FLOURISH, AND WHERE EVERY ONE OF US HAS
ACCESS TO A REMARKABLE RANGE OF HIGH-QUALITY CULTURAL EXPERIENCES

   We believe that creativity and culture are deeply connected, but
   different. Creativity is the process by which, either individually or
   with others, we make something new: a work of art, or a reimagining of
   an existing work. Culture is the result of that creative process: we
   encounter it in the world, in museums and libraries, theatres and
   galleries, carnivals and concert halls, festivals and digital spaces.
   In this Strategy, we are drawing a distinction between the two because
   we want everyone to have more opportunities for both: to be creative,
   and to experience high-quality culture. Having the time and tools to
   develop personal creative potential can be profoundly fulfilling, while
   engaging in culture is often a route to inspiration and delight. Taken
   together, they can help us make sense of ourselves and of each other:
   they provoke and uplift us; they unite communities; and they bring us
   joy. If access to either creativity or culture is limited by where
   people come from or what they do, the whole of society loses out.

Let's create a nation full of creators

   Many people already lead wide-ranging creative and cultural lives: they
   dance, draw and write; they read, visit museums, and listen to music;
   and they encourage their children to do the same. Much of this activity
   is not publicly funded, and has therefore traditionally fallen outside
   of the Arts Council’s remit. But with this Strategy, we aim to
   recognise and champion the creative activities and cultural experiences
   of every person in every town, village and city in this country, and to
   ensure that, over the next 10 years, we support more people to express
   and develop their creativity and create more opportunities for them to
   enjoy the widest possible range of culture. We will do this because we
   believe that everyone, everywhere should benefit from public investment
   in creativity and culture, given their power to fulfil us, and to
   transform the communities in which we live and work. And we will do
   this because we want England to strengthen its reputation as one of the
   most creative countries in the world.
