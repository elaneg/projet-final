Cell-based meat and other cell-based foods: how it is made and what are the
pros and cons

   Last Updated : 03 December 2025
   Table of contents

Key takeaways:

     * Cell-based foods (also called cultivated or lab-grown foods) are
       made by growing animal, plant or microbial cells in controlled
       conditions, rather than raising animals or crops in the traditional
       way.
     * Cultivated meat is produced from animal cells. Its production
       involves taking a small sample of cells, growing them in
       nutrient-rich media, and organising them into muscle, fat or other
       tissues.
     * Potential benefits of cell-based meat include reduced need for
       animal farming, improved animal welfare, and possibly fewer
       food-borne pathogens. But safety assessments are essential, as
       contamination risks still exist.
     * The environmental impact of cell-based meat remains uncertain.
       While cultivated meat could use less land and water, it currently
       requires high energy inputs, and long-term climate effects depend
       heavily on renewable energy use.
     * No cell-based foods are yet approved in the EU, but several
       products have been authorised elsewhere (e.g., Singapore, USA,
       Israel, Australia/New Zealand), and regulatory assessments are
       underway globally.
     * Consumer acceptance of cell-based meat remains low, and important
       questions about taste, nutrition, cost and labelling still need to
       be answered before these products reach supermarkets.

   There has been a lot of talk about lab-grown meat (also called
   cultivated or cell-based meat) in the news recently. This article
   explains what it is, how it’s made, and the barriers that will need to
   be overcome if we’re ever going to find it in supermarkets in Europe.

What are cell-based foods?

   Cell-based food is produced from cells isolated from animals, plants or
   microorganisms to produce food products. There is a growing trend to
   use the term “cellular agriculture” to describe the production of foods
   from animal or plant cells rather than from traditional agriculture.
   Foods produced by this form of technology are comparable to the
   existing animal products, such as meat, aquatic, dairy and plant
   products.

   Cell-based foods are produced by a well-established technology of
   cell-culture. Specialised cells (stem cells) are isolated from animals
   or plants and are placed in a nutrient rich growth medium where they
   are grown under controlled conditions. Here they develop into animal
   muscle or fat cells or plant products such as chocolate. The type of
   cell-based food will depend on the original stem-cell. For instance,
   stem-cells from eggs are used in the production of chicken nuggets and
   stem-cells from the cocoa plant are used in the production of
   chocolate.

What is cell-based meat and how is it made?

   An example of cell-based food is cell-based meat that refers to meat
   developed from animal cell culture, and not via traditional raising and
   slaughter of living animals.^1 It is not an imitation of meat made with
   other ingredients, like plant-based burgers that are made from
   plant-based proteins.

   The production process can be broken down into four steps:^1
    1. A sample of stem cells is taken from a live animal. Stems cells are
       cells that can develop into other specialised types of cells found
       in the body, for example, blood, liver or muscle cells.
    2. The stem cells are put in large tanks called bioreactors,
       containing culture media that recreate a similar environment to
       that which the cells would find in the animal’s body and provides
       them with the nutrients they need to multiply.
    3. The culture media is changed so that stem cells can differentiate
       into the three main components of meat: muscle, fat, and connective
       tissue.
    4. These cells are separated and arranged to “build” the type of meat
       that is being produced. This is called scaffolding. A scaffold is
       an edible material that supports the organisation of meat cells
       into the desired shape, for example, a steak, or mincemeat. The
       scaffold does more than just hold cells together. It also carries
       nutrients and helps them differentiate even further. In general,
       complex structures like steaks are more challenging to reproduce
       than burgers.

   This general production process is also used to produce products like
   chicken nuggets^2, foie gras^3,^4, and chocolate.^5 In recent years in
   Europe, we are seeing a rapid investment and growth in the cell-based
   food sector that will likely lead to the increased availability of
   these products on the market.^6

What are some pros and cons of cell-based meat?

   Animal welfare is one reason for producing lab-grown meat. This
   production method can produce meat without the need for raising and
   slaughtering a large number of animals and therefore, has the potential
   to increase animal welfare within the food system.^7 However, the
   process currently still relies on stem cells obtained from a live
   animal, and the most widely used culture medium contains fetal bovine
   serum (FBS), which is collected from foetal blood at animal
   slaughterhouses, so it is not yet entirely slaughter-free.^8

   Some advocates of lab-based meat also consider improved food safety as
   an advantage of lab-grown meat. This is because, in the controlled lab
   environment, meat products will not face the traditional risk of
   contamination with illness-causing bacteria like E.coli or
   Campylobacter, which usually come from the gut of livestock. However,
   as with any industrial food production, microbiological or chemical
   contamination can still occur at different stages. Thorough safety
   assessments will be needed before they can be sold in Europe.^9

   More sustainable production of protein will be crucial in the next 30
   years, considering that the world population is expected to grow to 9
   billion by 2050 and sustainability is an important motivation to
   produce lab-grown meat. However, it is not clear yet whether mass-scale
   production of meat in the lab will be more environmentally sustainable
   than traditional animal husbandry. While less of some resources such as
   water, land and fertilizers, are needed compared to what is needed to
   grow feed crops and livestock,^10^,11^ other aspects are more
   complicated. For example:
     * While a reduction of cattle farming would decrease methane
       emissions that contribute to climate change, recent modelling
       studies have suggested that lab-based meat production could
       generate problematic levels of CO2 emissions over the long
       term.^12
     * Producing cultivated meat requires significant energy input, which
       could pose a problem if fossil fuels are used to power the
       production process. The use of renewable energy will be key to
       addressing sustainability issues.^12

Is cell-based meat suitable for vegetarians or vegans?

   Cell-based meat is an old food produced in a new way, which raises a
   few questions. In the early days, vegans and vegetarians would have
   rejected cell-based meat completely, because it used foetal bovine
   serum (FBS) as the growth medium. However since then, companies have
   been working to replace FBS with a growth medium that doesn’t come from
   animals, and this was achieved for the first time in 2022.^13 While
   cell-based meat is still considered meat, those who refuse to eat meat
   for animal welfare reasons may choose to eat it when produced in this
   way.

Is it likely that human breast milk can be produced using cell-based
technology?

   The production of cell-based breast milk is an area of active research
   with a focus of replacing or improving the nutritional quality of
   powdered infant formula.^14 While breast feeding is the best possible
   option for infants, cultivating mammary cells may offer a product with
   nutritional characteristics closer to the unique composition of human
   breast milk. However, current scientific opinion is that cell-based
   human milk products are unlikely to truly replicate the composition and
   health benefits of human milk.^15

Is cell-based meat halal/kosher?

   Singapore was the first country to approve the marketing of a
   cell-based chicken product. In February 2024, the Fatwa Committee of
   Singapore issued religious guidance that addressed the issues of
   consumption and production of cell-based meat. The Fatwa Committee
   stated that, assuming the right conditions are fulfilled, cultivated
   meat is generally halal or permissible to be consumed by Muslims.^16
   Similarly, the Fatwa Council of the United Arab Emirates approved the
   manufacture and consumption of proteins derived from cell-based meat
   provided that the animals from which the cells are derived have been
   lawfully slaughtered according to Islamic regulations.^17However, there
   is still an active debate regarding the conditions for approving
   cell-based food as suitable for Muslims.^18

   In January 2024, Israel became the first country in the world to
   authorise the marketing of a cell-based beef product. The religious
   authorities in Israel ruled that this cell-based meat product was
   kosher and pareve (neither meat nor dairy) because the meat was grown
   from stem cells taken from a fertilised egg rather than cells extracted
   from muscle tissue.^19

Is cell-based meat approved in the EU?

   As cell-based foods are classified as novel foods under EU food
   regulations, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is required to
   carry out a scientific risk assessment for these products by evaluating
   their safety before they can be authorised for sale in the EU. In
   Europe, before a novel food can be placed on the market, it must be
   approved by the European Commission. To date, no cell-based foods have
   been approved in the European Union.

   There are, however, a number of cell-based foods on the market outside
   the EU. The UK has approved a cell-based chicken product as an
   ingredient in pet food.^20 Cell-based chicken products (chicken
   nuggets) have been approved in Singapore and the USA. The USA has also
   approved a cell-based salmon product for sale.^21 Israeli has approved
   a cell-based beef product and in Australia/New Zealand a cell-based
   quail foie gras has been approved.^22

   It is too soon to know whether cell-based meat will be labelled as
   ‘meat.’ In the EU, the legal definition of meat (which was created when
   animals were its only possible source) is ‘skeletal muscle deriving
   from specified animal species.’ In the case of cultivated meat,
   however, there is no animal and no skeleton, so it’s not clear if the
   existing definition will be sufficient to cover cell-based meat or not.
   At the moment, labelling of cell-based meat is under review in the
   United States where a public consultation is underway.^23

Will cell-cultured meat replace traditional meat?

   If cell-based meat is going to replace a significant percentage of the
   meat that we eat, consumer acceptance will be key. Current studies
   indicate that people are still quite reluctant to accept cultured meat,
   although acceptance can be increased by the way information about the
   product is presented.^24 For now, people seem more likely to prefer
   plant-based options when considering alternative proteins.^24 However,
   most available consumer research on cell-based meat is based upon
   hypothetical situations and very few consumers have had the opportunity
   to taste cultivated meat so far. There are not many studies on the
   sensorial properties, so we don’t have much information about how the
   taste and texture compares to traditional meat.^25
   It is also difficult to say whether the nutritional value of these
   novel products will be the same. The reason for the uncertainty is that
   producing cell-based meat is complex and expensive and most of the
   knowledge is owned by the companies who have invested in developing the
   technology. There are not many samples available for independent
   researchers, so much of the available data is so far either theoretical
   or based on information provided by start-ups themselves.^26

   While there are many questions still to be answered about cell-based,
   EFSA has announced an increased focus on cell-culture derived foods,
   which may be a step towards paving the way to finding these products on
   European supermarket shelves.
