   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Systematic difference between two cultures

   A culture gap is any systematic difference between two cultures which
   hinders mutual understanding or relations. Such differences include the
   values, behavior, education, and customs of the respective
   cultures.^[1] As international communications, travel, and trade have
   expanded, some of the communication and cultural divisions have
   lessened. Books on how to handle and be aware of cultural differences
   seek to prepare business people and travelers.^[2] Immigrants and
   migrant laborers need to learn the ways of a new culture.^[3] Tourists
   can also be confronted with variants in protocols for tipping, body
   language, personal space, dress codes, and other cultural issues.
   Language instructors try to teach cultural differences as well.^[4]

Legal

   [edit]
   Main article: Legal culture

   A legal culture is a system of laws and precedents peculiar to a
   nation, region, religion, or other organized group. A culture gap
   occurs when incompatible or opposing systems might be applied to the
   same situation or assumed by the parties. Legal constructs such as
   contracts and corporations are not uniform across cultures. In some
   cases, such a gap is intentionally sought by one party, as in forum
   shopping for a more favorable legal framework or in libel tourism, by
   which speech protected in one jurisdiction may be actionable in
   another.

Generational

   [edit]
   Main article: Generation gap

   A generation gap occurs when the experiences and attitudes of one
   generation differ significantly from those of another. The world wars
   contributed to generation gaps in several nations. The term first saw
   widespread use in contrasting the Baby Boomer generation with their
   parents. The "Youth culture" of adolescents and teenagers seeking to
   stake out their own identity and independence from their parents often
   results in a cultural divide. Younger generations have experienced
   different technologies, freedoms and standards of propriety.^[5]

Gender and sexual identity

Urban

Professional

   [edit]

   Communication between and collaboration among scientific disciplines is
   sometimes hindered by use of different paradigms or competition between
   the desires to describe a simple explanatory framework and elucidate
   fine details. The framework of the questions to which each field lends
   itself may differ, leading to frustration and wasted effort.^[6]

Educational

   [edit]

   The education culture is the different education people receive in
   their life. A culture gap occurs when people with different cultures
   sit together and take the same class. Different cultures behave
   differently towards the teacher both in class and after class.
   Differences can be noticed in assessment method and the direction
   method of the class.

   Asian students focus on books and exercises more than European and
   American students, who are willing to raise questions in the classes.
   The cultural gap in education is due to the different education
   traditions in different places.

   For example, Asian students receive exam-oriented education, but
   European and American students receive a very different, freer
   education and are both expected to challenge their teachers and
   strongly encouraged to challenge the teachers in class.

   In both China and Japan, the education system normally usually uses
   exams to show a student's ability. In American and Britain, students
   grade instructors according to ability.

   Both systems have advantages and disadvantages but form a cultural gap
   between people. Different ways of thinking and analyzing things makes
   students view things very differently.^[7]
