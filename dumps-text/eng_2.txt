   Animal flesh produced by culturing cells

   The first cell-cultured hamburger, cooked at a news conference in
   London, 2013
   Cultured chicken in pasta salad, served at a restaurant in Singapore,
   2023

   Cultured meat, also known as cultivated meat among other names, is a
   form of cellular agriculture wherein meat is produced by culturing
   animal cells in vitro.^[1]^[2]^[3]^[4]^[5] This process involves the
   molecularly identical growth of animal flesh, outside of a living
   animal. Cultured meat is produced using tissue engineering techniques
   pioneered in regenerative medicine.^[6] It has been noted for potential
   to mitigate the impact of meat production on the environment^[3] and
   addressing issues around animal welfare, food security, and human
   health.^[7]^[8]^[9]^[10]^[11]^[12]^[13]
   Mark Post of the University of Maastricht presents The Meat Revolution,
   a lecture about cultured meat, 2015Isha Datar of New Harvest on how a
   "post-animal bio-economy" can be brought about through cultured meat,
   eggs, and milk, 2017

   Jason Matheny popularized the concept in the early 2000s after he
   co-authored a paper^[14] on cultured meat production and created New
   Harvest, the world's first non-profit organization dedicated to in
   vitro meat research.^[15] In 2013, Mark Post created a hamburger patty
   made from tissue grown outside of an animal; other cultured meat
   prototypes have gained media attention since. In 2020, SuperMeat opened
   a farm-to-fork restaurant in Tel Aviv called The Chicken, serving
   cultured chicken burgers in exchange for reviews to test consumer
   reaction rather than money;^[16]^[17] while the "world's first
   commercial sale of cell-cultured meat" occurred in December 2020 at
   Singapore restaurant 1880, where cultured chicken manufactured by
   United States firm Eat Just was sold.^[18]^[19]

   Most efforts focus on common meats such as pork, beef, and chicken;
   species which constitute the bulk of conventional meat consumption in
   developed countries.^[20] Some companies have pursued various species
   of fish and other seafood,^[21] such as Avant Meats who brought
   cultured grouper to market in 2021.^[22] Other companies such as
   Orbillion Bio have focused on high-end or unusual meats including elk,
   lamb, bison, and Wagyu beef.^[23]

   The production process of cultured meat is constantly evolving, driven
   by companies and research institutions.^[24] The applications for
   cultured meat havе led to ethical,^[25] health, environmental,
   cultural, and economic discussions.^[26] Data published by The Good
   Food Institute found that in 2021 through 2023, cultured meat and
   seafood companies attracted over $2.5 billion in investment
   worldwide.^[27] However, cultured meat is not yet widely available.

   A 2025 study demonstrated that cow cells can be produced safely and
   stably in a laboratory setting through natural means, without genetic
   modification or any abnormal transformation.^[28]

Nomenclature

   [edit]

   Besides cultured meat, the terms cultivated meat,^[29]^[30] clean
   meat,^[31]^[32] in vitro meat, cell-based meat,^[33] synthetic
   meat,^[34] slaughter-free meat,^[35] craft meat,^[36]^[37] healthy
   meat,^[38] and schmeat^[39]^[40] have been used to describe the
   product. Although it has multiple meanings, artificial meat is
   occasionally used.^[41] The term lab-grown meat has been used in news
   media,^[42] but has been criticized on the basis that as production
   reaches market-scale, it won't be grown in laboratories but rather
   larger-output facilities which Bruce Friedrich compares to "meat
   breweries".^[32]

   Between 2016 and 2019, clean meat gained traction. The Good Food
   Institute (GFI) coined the term in 2016,^[43] and in late 2018, the
   institute published research claiming that use of clean better
   reflected the production process and benefits.^[44]^[45] By 2018 it had
   surpassed cultured and in vitro in media mentions and Google
   searches.^[46] Some stakeholders in cultured meat production, seeking
   to work with conventional meat producers as allies, felt that the term
   clean meat unnecessarily tarnished the latter, and went on to prefer
   cell-based meat as a neutral alternative.^[47]^[48]

   In September 2019, GFI announced new research which found that the term
   cultivated meat is sufficiently descriptive and differentiating,
   possesses a high degree of neutrality, and ranks highly for consumer
   appeal.^[29]^[49] A September 2021 poll indicated that the majority of
   industry CEOs have a preference for cultivated meat, with 75 percent of
   44 companies preferring it.^[50]

History

   [edit]

Initial research

   [edit]

   The theoretical possibility of growing meat in an industrial setting
   has long been of interest. In a 1931 essay published by various
   periodicals and later included in his work Thoughts and Adventures,
   British statesman Winston Churchill wrote: "We shall escape the
   absurdity of growing a whole chicken to eat the breast or wing, by
   growing these parts separately under a suitable medium."^[51]

   In the 1950s, Dutch researcher Willem van Eelen independently came up
   with the idea for cultured meat. As a prisoner of war during the Second
   World War, Van Eelen suffered from starvation, leaving him passionate
   about food production and food security.^[52] He attended a university
   lecture discussing the prospects of preserved meat.^[53] The earlier
   discovery of cell lines provided the basis for the idea. In vitro
   cultivation of muscle fibers was first performed successfully in 1971
   when pathologist Russell Ross cultured guinea pig aorta. However, In
   1991, Jon F. Vein secured patent
   US 6835390  for the production of tissue-engineered meat for human
   consumption, wherein muscle and fat would be grown in an integrated
   fashion to create food products.^[54]

   In 2001, dermatologist Wiete Westerhof along with van Eelen and
   businessperson Willem van Kooten announced that they had filed for a
   worldwide patent on a process to produce cultured meat.^[55] The
   process employed a matrix of collagen seeded with muscle cells bathed
   in a nutritious solution and induced to divide.^[56] That same year,
   NASA began conducting cultured meat experiments, with the intent of
   allowing astronauts to grow meat instead of transporting it. In
   partnership with Morris Benjaminson, they cultivated goldfish and
   turkey.^[57] In 2003, Oron Catts and Ionat Zurr exhibited a few
   centimeters of "steak", grown from frog stem cells, which they cooked
   and ate. The goal was to start a conversation surrounding the ethics of
   cultured meat—"was it ever alive?", "was it ever killed?", "is it in
   any way disrespectful to an animal to throw it away?"^[58]

   In the early 2000s, American public health student Jason Matheny
   traveled to India and visited a factory chicken farm. Appalled by the
   implications of this system, he later teamed up with three scientists
   involved in NASA's efforts. In 2004, Matheny founded New Harvest to
   encourage development by funding research. In 2005, the four published
   the first peer-reviewed literature on the subject.^[59]

   In May 2008, PETA offered a $1 million prize to the first company to
   bring cultured chicken meat to consumers by 2012.^[60] The contestant
   was required to complete two tasks to earn the prize, namely to produce
   a cultured chicken meat product that was indistinguishable from real
   chicken and produce the product in large enough quantities to be
   competitively sold in at least 10 states. The contest was later
   extended until 4 March 2014. The deadline eventually expired without a
   winner.^[61]

   The Dutch government has invested $4 million into experiments regarding
   cultured meat.^[62] The In Vitro Meat Consortium, a group formed by
   international researchers, held the first international conference
   hosted by the Norwegian Food Research Institute in April 2008.^[63]
   Time magazine declared cultured meat production to be one of the 50
   breakthrough ideas of 2009.^[64] In November 2009, scientists from the
   Netherlands announced they had managed to grow meat using cells from a
   live pig.^[65]

First public trial

   [edit]

   The first cultured beef burger patty was created by Mark Post at
   Maastricht University in 2013.^[66] It was made from over 20,000 thin
   strands of muscle tissue, cost over $325,000 and needed 2 years to
   produce.^[67] The burger was tested on live television in London on 5
   August 2013. It was cooked by chef Richard McGeown of Couch's Great
   House Restaurant in Polperro, Cornwall, and tasted by critics Hanni
   Rützler, a food researcher from the Future Food Studio, and Josh
   Schonwald. Rützler stated, "There is really a bite to it, there is
   quite some flavour with the browning. I know there is no fat in it so I
   didn't really know how juicy it would be, but there is quite some
   intense taste; it's close to meat, it's not that juicy, but the
   consistency is perfect. This is meat to me... It's really something to
   bite on and I think the look is quite similar." Rützler added that even
   in a blind trial she would have taken the product for meat rather than
   a soya copy.^[68]

Industry development

   [edit]
   The first cultured hamburger: raw, fried, and tasted by Hanni Rützler
   on 5 August 2013

     It's just a matter of time before this is gonna happen, I'm
     absolutely convinced of that. In our case, I estimate the time to be
     about 3 years before we are ready to enter the market on a small
     scale, about 5 years to enter the market on a larger scale, and if
     you'd ask me: "When will [cultured meat] be in the supermarket
     around the corner?" That'll be closer to 10 than to 5 years, I
     think.

   Peter Verstrate, Mosa Meat (2018)^[69]^: 1:06:15 

   Between 2011 and 2017, many cultured meat startups were launched.^[70]
   Memphis Meats, now known as Upside Foods,^[71] launched a video in
   February 2016, showcasing its cultured beef meatball.^[72]^[73]^[74] In
   March 2017, it showcased chicken tenders and duck a l'orange, the first
   cultured poultry shown to the public.^[75]^[76]^[77] An Israeli
   company, SuperMeat, ran a crowdfunding campaign in 2016, for its work
   on cultured chicken.^[78]^[79]^[80]^[81]^[82] Finless Foods, a San
   Francisco-based company working on cultured fish, was founded in June
   2016. In March 2017 it commenced laboratory operations.^[83]

   In March 2018, Eat Just (in 2011 founded as Hampton Creek in San
   Francisco, later known as Just, Inc.) claimed to be able to offer a
   consumer product from cultured meat by the end of 2018. According to
   CEO Josh Tetrick the technology was already there. JUST had about 130
   employees and a research department of 55 scientists, where cultured
   meat from poultry, pork and beef was researched. JUST has received
   investments from Chinese billionaire Li Ka-shing, Yahoo! co-founder
   Jerry Yang and according to Tetrick also by Heineken International and
   others.^[84]

   Dutch startup Meatable, consisting of Krijn de Nood, Daan Luining, Ruud
   Out, Roger Pederson, Mark Kotter and Gordana Apic among others,
   reported in September 2018 that it had succeeded in growing meat using
   pluripotent stem cells from animal umbilical cords. Although such cells
   are reportedly difficult to work with, Meatable claimed to be able to
   direct them to behave to become muscle or fat cells as needed. The
   major advantage is that this technique bypasses fetal bovine serum,
   meaning that no animal has to be killed to produce meat.^[85] That
   month, an estimated 30 cultured meat startups operated across the
   world.^[69] IntegriCulture is a Japan-based company working on their
   CulNet system.^[clarification needed] Competitors included England
   based Multus Media and Canadian Future Fields.^[86]

   In August 2019, five American startups announced the formation of the
   Alliance for Meat, Poultry & Seafood Innovation (AMPS Innovation), a
   coalition seeking to work with regulators to create a pathway to market
   for cultured meat and seafood.^[87] The founding members include Eat
   Just, Memphis Meats, Finless Foods, BlueNalu, and Fork & Goode.^[88]
   Similarly in December 2021, a group of 13 European and Israeli
   companies (Aleph Farms, Bluu Biosciences, Cubiq Foods, Future Meat,
   Gourmey, Higher Steaks, Ivy Farm, Meatable, Mirai Foods, Mosa Meat,
   Peace of Meat, SuperMeat, and Vital Meat) established Cellular
   Agriculture Europe, a Belgium-based association that sought to 'find
   common ground and speak with a shared voice for the good of the
   industry, consumers, and regulators'.^[89]^[90]^[91]

   In October 2019, Aleph Farms collaborated with 3D Bioprinting Solutions
   to culture meat on the International Space Station. This was done by
   extruding meat cells onto a scaffold using a 3D printer.^[92] In
   January 2020, Quartz found around 30 cultured meat startups, and that
   Memphis Meats, Just Inc. and Future Meat Technologies were the most
   advanced because they were building pilot plants.^[93]^[94] According
   to New Scientist in May 2020, 60 start-ups were developing cultured
   meat. Some of these were technology suppliers.^[95] Growth media
   reportedly still cost "hundreds of dollars per litre, but for clean
   meat production to scale this needs to drop to around $1 a litre."^[95]
   In June 2020, Chinese government officials called for a national
   strategy to compete in cultured meat.^[96]

   In December 2019, the Foieture project was launched in Belgium with the
   goal of developing cultured foie gras (the name is a portmanteau of
   'foie' and 'future') by a consortium of 3 companies (cultured-meat
   startup Peace of Meat, small meat-seasoning company Solina, and small
   pâté-producing company Nauta) and 3 non-profit institutes (university
   KU Leuven, food industry innovation centre Flanders Food, and Bio Base
   Europe Pilot Plant).^[97] Peace of Meat stated in December 2019 that it
   intended to complete its proof of concept in 2020, to produce its first
   prototype in 2022, and to go to market in 2023.^[97] That month, the
   Foieture project received a research grant of almost 3.6 million euros
   from the Innovation and Enterprise Agency of the Flemish
   Government.^[97] In May 2020, Peace of Meat's Austrian-born cofounder
   and scientific researcher Eva Sommer stated that the startup was then
   able to produce 20 grams of cultured fat at a cost of about 300 euros
   (€15,000/kg); the goal was to reduce the price to 6 euros per kilogram
   by 2030.^[98] Piece of Meat built two laboratories in the Port of
   Antwerp.^[98] In late 2020, MeaTech acquired Peace of Meat for 15
   million euros, and announced in May 2021 that it would build a new
   large-scale pilot plant in Antwerp by 2022.^[99]

   In November 2020, Indian start-up Clear Meat claimed it had managed to
   cultivate chicken mince at the cost of only 800–850 Indian rupees
   (US$10.77–11.44), while a slaughtered processed chicken cost about
   1,000 rupees.^[100] On 27 April 2022, the European Commission approved
   the request for the collection of signatures for the European Citizens'
   Initiative End The Slaughter Age to shift subsidies from animal
   husbandry to cellular agriculture.^[101]

   According to a November 2023 report by Oghma Partners, 46.9% of all
   funds – over 2.6 billion British pounds – raised for cultivated meat
   start-ups between 2016 and 2023 went to a top five, comprising Upside
   Foods (21.5%; formerly Memphis Meats), Believer Meats (formerly Future
   Meat Technologies), Wildtype, Aleph Farms, and Mosa Meat.^[102]

Market entry

   [edit]
   See also: List of cultured meat companies

     There is a handful [of startups]. It's quite interesting to see,
     there are three hubs: one in Silicon Valley, one in the Netherlands
     and one in Israel. I think that's because these three places have
     firstly, a great agricultural university – we've got Wageningen;
     secondly, a great medical university – for us that's Leiden; and
     finally we've got Delft on the engineering side. Those three
     combined gives you a firm basis to [develop cultured meat], and that
     [combination] exists in Israel, the Netherlands and America.

Australia and New Zealand entry

   [edit]

   On 7 April 2025, Vow quail became the first cultured meat product to be
   officially approved for sale in Australia and New Zealand.^[104] In
   mid-June 2025, Vow expected to be serving its cultivated quail in
   restaurants in Sydney and Melbourne "within weeks".^[105]^[106]

European Union and Switzerland entry

   [edit]

   In the European Union, novel foods such as cultured meat products have
   to go through a testing period of about 18 months during which a
   company must prove to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) that
   their product is safe.^[107]^[108] In March 2022, cultured meat
   producers had reached the level of attempting to gain regulatory
   approval from European Union supranational institutions coming just
   before mass goods could be sold to consumers.^[3] By February 2023,
   none had yet submitted a novel food dossier for approval by the
   EFSA.^[108] Legal experts explained this as having to do with the fact
   that, although the EFSA's novel food procedure has been
   well-established since 1997 (unlike in other jurisdictions, that still
   have or had to develop certain regulatory standards), it is a long and
   complicated process in which companies can have little input once they
   have submitted their request, unlike cultured meat startups in the
   United States (who could easily communicate back and forth with the FDA
   to clarify any issues), and in the UK, Singapore and Israel (where
   governments have implemented a 'single point of contact' responsible
   for the overall process).^[108]

   Aleph Farms was the first start-up to apply for approval of its
   cultivated beef steaks in Switzerland in July 2023.^[109] While not
   part of the European Union, Switzerland was regarded as an important
   case study with great interest from legal scholars around the world,
   and expected to have widespread implications for the EU countries
   surrounding it.^[110]

   In April 2024, the Dutch start-up Meatable hosted the first legally
   approved public proof‑of‑concept tasting of cultured meat in the
   European Union - a sausage - following ad hoc approval by a national
   expert committee under a newly introduced Dutch code of practice. The
   event attracted significant national and international media
   attention.^[111]^[112]^[113] Meatable CTO Daan Luining cautioned it
   would take several years to scale up production to serve all
   supermarkets, that cultured meat was just an alternative that would
   gradually become more widely available, giving consumers more choices,
   and that the traditional meat industry would not be replaced any time
   soon.^[112]

   In July 2024, French startup Gourmey was the first company in Europe to
   apply for regulatory approval at the EFSA, followed by pioneer Mark
   Post's Mosa Meat from the Netherlands in January 2025.^[114] Just two
   weeks later, after securing 1.5 million euros in a crowdfunding
   campaign within 24 minutes, Mosa Meat teamed up with Swiss meat
   processor Bell Food Group to apply for regulatory approval for its
   cultivated beef fat in Switzerland as well,^[115] and in May 2025 it
   submitted its application at the Food Standards Agency in the United
   Kingdom.^[116]

Israel entry

   [edit]

   In November 2020, SuperMeat opened a test restaurant in Ness Ziona,
   Israel, right next to its pilot plant; journalists, experts and a small
   number of consumers could book an appointment to taste the novel food
   there, while looking through a glass window into the production
   facility on the other side. The restaurant was not yet fully open to
   the public, because as of June 2021 SuperMeat still needed to wait for
   regulatory approval to start mass production for public consumption,
   and because the COVID-19 pandemic restricted restaurant
   operations.^[117]^[118] By February 2023, Israeli authorities had
   established a regulatory structure similar to that of Singapore, and
   shown a general willingness to work towards approval (as well as
   financing research for cultivated food innovation), but were still in
   the process of developing safety regulations in consultations with
   researchers and other experts.^[108] For example, the Israeli Health
   Ministry and UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) co-organised a
   convention of cultivated food safety regulation experts in September
   2022.^[108]

   In January 2024, the Ministry of Health in Israel granted regulatory
   approval for cultured beef to Aleph Farms.^[119]^[120]

Singapore entry

   [edit]

   On 2 December 2020, the Singapore Food Agency approved the "chicken
   bites" produced by Eat Just for commercial sale. It marked the first
   time that a cultured meat product passed the safety review (which took
   2 years) of a food regulator, and was widely regarded as a milestone
   for the industry. The chicken bits were scheduled for introduction in
   Singaporean restaurants.^[121] Restaurant "1880" became the first to
   serve cultured meat to customers on Saturday 19 December
   2020.^[122]^[123]

   In January 2023, the SFA also granted regulatory approval for the
   production of cultured meat with serum-free media to Eat Just
   subsidiary GOOD Meat, which had introduced its cultivated chicken
   product in several more Singaporean restaurants as well as hawker
   centres and food delivery services since 2020, and was constructing the
   bioreactors for its new facility in Singapore.^[124] This world-first
   approval was said to be a milestone in making cultivated meat
   production more scalable and efficient.^[124] In April 2024, Australian
   start-up Vow obtained Singaporean approval for its cultured
   quail;^[113] while Dutch start-up Meatable would be introducing its
   cultivated pork sausages in several restaurants in Singapore later in
   2024.^[113]

United States entry

   [edit]

   In November 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) completed the
   pre-market consultation of Upside Foods (formerly Memphis Meats),
   concluding that its products were safe to eat, a first for cultivated
   meat companies in the United States.^[125] Approval from the final
   agency, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) was received
   by Upside Foods and Good Meat, both for cultivated chicken, in June
   2023.^[126]^[127] On 28 May 2025, Wildtype obtained regulatory approval
   from the FDA to sell its cultivated coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch)
   product on the U.S. market.^[128] With that, Wildtype became the first
   start-up to be permitted to sell cultivated seafood in the United
   States, and a few days later, it was on the menu at the Kann restaurant
   of Gregory Gourdet in Portland, Oregon.^[128]

United Kingdom entry

   [edit]

   On 6 February 2025, it was announced that British pet food company THE
   PACK (acquired by Prefera Petfood in May 2025^[129]) would release the
   first commercially available product for pets containing cultivated
   chicken made by Meatly the following day.^[130]

   diagram of cultured meat's production process

Cell lines

   [edit]

   Cellular agriculture requires cell lines, generally stem cells. Stem
   cells are undifferentiated cells which have the potential to become
   many or all of the required kinds of specialized cell types. Totipotent
   stem cells have the capacity to differentiate into all the different
   cell types found within the body. Pluripotent stem cells can mature
   into all cell types save those in the placenta, and multipotent stem
   cells can differentiate into several specialized cell types within one
   lineage. Unipotent stem cells can differentiate into one specific cell
   fate.^[131]
   [330px-Stem_cell_differentiation.svg.png] Stem cells can differentiate
   into a range of specialized cells.

   While pluripotent stem cells would be an ideal source, the most
   prominent example of this subcategory is embryonic stem cells which—due
   to ethical issues^[which?]—are controversial for use in research. As a
   result, scientists have developed induced pluripotent stem cells
   (iPSCs)—essentially multipotent blood and skin cells that have been
   regressed to a pluripotent state enabling them to differentiate into a
   greater range of cells.^[132] The alternative is using multipotent
   adult stem cells that give rise to muscle cell lineages or unipotent
   progenitors which differentiate into muscle cells.^[131]

   Favourable characteristics of stem cells include immortality,
   proliferative ability, unreliance on adherence, serum independence and
   easy differentiation into tissue. The natural presence of such
   characteristics are likely to differ across cell species and origin. As
   such, in vitro cultivation must be adjusted to fill the exact needs of
   a specific cell line. The immortality issue is that cells have a limit
   on the number of times they can divide that is dictated by their
   telomere cap—supplementary nucleotide bases added to the end of their
   chromosomes. With each division, the telomere cap progressively
   shortens until nothing remains, at which time the cells cease to
   divide. Induced pluripotency can lengthen telomere cap such that the
   cells divide indefinitely.^[132]

   Cell lines can be collected from a primary source, i.e., through a
   biopsy on an animal under local anesthesia. They could also be
   established from secondary sources such as cryopreserved cultures
   (cultures frozen after previous research).^[133]

Growth medium

   [edit]
   [330px-Myoblasts.png] Myoblasts are one precursor to muscle cells.
   Their fibers here are shown in yellow and their nuclei in blue.

   Once cell lines are established, they are immersed in a culture medium
   to induce them to proliferate. Culture media are typically formulated
   from basal media that provide cells with necessary carbohydrates, fats,
   proteins and salts. Once a cell consumes a sufficient amount, it
   divides and the population increases exponentially. Culture media can
   be supplemented with additives—for instance sera—that supply additional
   growth factors. Growth factors can be secreted proteins or steroids
   that are crucial in regulating cellular processes.^[2]

   Once differentiation begins, muscle fibres begin to contract and
   generate lactic acid. Cells' ability to absorb nutrients and
   proliferate in part depends on the pH of their environment. As lactic
   acid accumulates within the medium, the environment will become
   progressively more acidic and falls below the optimal pH. As a result,
   culture media must be frequently refreshed. This helps refresh the
   concentration of nutrients from the basal media.^[24]

Scaffolds

   [edit]
   [330px-Muscle_Tissue_Smooth_%2840087100000%29.jpg] Muscle tissue is
   developed from the growth medium. The scaffold organizes in a
   three-dimensional structure for the end product.

   In the case of structured meat products—products that are characterized
   by their overall configuration as well as cell type—cells must be
   seeded to scaffolds. Scaffolds are essentially molds meant to reflect
   and encourage the cells to organize into a larger structure. When cells
   develop in vivo, they are influenced by their interactions with the
   extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM is the 3-dimensional mesh of
   glycoproteins, collagen and enzymes responsible for transmitting
   mechanical and biochemical cues to the cell. Scaffolds need to simulate
   the characteristics of the ECM.^[2]

Porosity

   [edit]

   Pores are minute openings on the surface of the scaffold. They can be
   created on the surface of the biomaterial in order to release cellular
   components that could interfere with tissue development. They also help
   diffuse gas and nutrients to the innermost layers of adherent cells,
   preventing a "necrotic center" from forming. A necrotic center is a
   phenomenon in which cells that are not in direct contact with the
   culture medium die from a lack of nutrients.^[134]

Vascularization

   [edit]

   Vascular tissue found in plants contains the organs responsible for
   internally transporting fluids. It forms natural topographies that
   provide a low cost way to promote cell alignment by replicating the
   natural physiological state of myoblasts. It may also help with gas and
   nutrient exchange.^[134]

Biochemical properties

   [edit]

   A scaffold's biochemical properties should be similar to those of the
   ECM. It must facilitate cell adhesion through textural qualities or
   chemical bonding. Additionally, it must produce the chemical cues that
   encourage cell differentiation. Alternatively, the material should be
   able to blend with other substances which have these functional
   qualities.^[134]

Crystallinity

   [edit]

   The degree of a material's crystallinity determines qualities such as
   rigidity. High crystallinity can be attributed to hydrogen bonding
   which in turn increases thermal stability, tensile strength (important
   for maintaining the scaffold's shape), water retention (important for
   hydrating the cells) and Young's modulus.^[134]

Degradation

   [edit]

   Certain materials degrade into compounds that are beneficial to cells,
   although this degradation can also be irrelevant or detrimental.
   Degradation allows easy removal of the scaffold from the finished
   product leaving only animal tissue—thereby increasing its resemblance
   to in vivo meat. This degradation can be induced by exposure to certain
   enzymes which do not impact the muscle tissue.^[134]

Edibility

   [edit]

   If scaffolds are unable to be removed from the animal tissue, they must
   be edible to ensure consumer safety. It would be beneficial if they
   were to be made out of nutritious ingredients.^[134] Since 2010,
   academic research groups and companies have been working to identify
   raw materials that have the characteristics of suitable
   scaffolds.^[134]^[135]^[136]^[137]^[138]^[139]

Cellulose

   [edit]

   Cellulose is the most abundant polymer in nature and provides the
   exoskeletons of plant leaves. Due to its abundance, it can be obtained
   at a relatively low cost. It is also versatile and biocompatible.
   Through a process called "decellularization", it is coated in a
   surfactant that creates pores. These pores release the plant's cellular
   components, and it becomes decellularized plant tissue. This material
   has been extensively studied by the Pelling and Gaudette Groups at
   University of Ottawa and Worcester Polytechnic Institute, respectively.
   Through cross-linking (forming covalent bonds between individual
   polymer chains to hold them together) the plant tissue's mechanical
   properties can be changed so that it more closely resembles muscle
   tissue. This can also be done by blending plant tissue with other
   materials. On the other hand, decellularized plant tissue typically
   lacks mammalian biochemical cues, so it needs to be coated with
   compensatory functional proteins. C2C12 growth was not shown to change
   significantly between the bare scaffold and the same scaffold with a
   coating of collagen or gelatin proteins; however, seeding efficiency
   (rate at which cells attach to the scaffold) improved.^[134]^[135]

   An advantage of decellularized plant tissue is the natural topography
   afforded by the leaf vasculature. This helps replicate the natural
   physiological state of the myoblasts which promotes cell alignment. The
   other ways of doing this are usually quite a bit more expensive
   including 3D printing, soft lithography and photolithography.
   Vascularization can also help overcome the 100–200 nm diffusion limit
   of culture medium into cells that usually produce necrotic centres in
   muscle conglomerates. Another way to do this is by having a porous
   scaffold which supports angiogenesis (the development of new blood
   vessels). While this has been shown to work for apple Hypanthium, not
   all plants are nearly as porous. The alternative to plant cellulose is
   bacterial cellulose which is typically more pure than plant cellulose
   as it is free from contaminants such as lignin and hemicellulose.
   Bacterial cellulose has more hydrogen bonding between its polymer
   strands and so it has greater crystallinity. It also has smaller
   microfibrils that allow it to retain more moisture and have smaller
   pores. The substance can be produced using waste carbohydrates (which
   may allow it to be produced less expensively) and it adds juiciness and
   chewiness to emulsified meat (which would mean that even if it can't be
   taken out of the final product, it will contribute to the texture
   profile).^[134]^[135]

   Decellularized plants that have been studied as possible scaffold
   materials include spinach, bamboo, algae, apple, celery, and Aloe
   vera.^[140]^[141]

Chitin

   [edit]

   Chitin is nature's second most abundant polymer. It is found in the
   exoskeletons of arthropods and fungi. As cellular agriculture is
   attempting to end reliance on animals, chitin derived from fungi is of
   greater interest. It has mostly been studied by Pelling Group. Chitosan
   is derived from chitin in a process known as alkaline deacetylation
   (substituting out certain amino acid groups). The degree of this
   process determines the physical and chemical properties of the
   chitosan. Chitosan has antibacterial properties; in particular, it has
   bactericidal effects on planktonic bacteria and biofilms and a bacteria
   static effects on gram negative bacteria such as E. coli. This is
   important as it neutralizes potentially harmful compounds without using
   antibiotics, which many consumers avoid. Chitosan's resemblance to
   glycosaminoglycans and internal interactions between glycoproteins and
   proteoglycans make it highly biocompatible. It can easily blend with
   other polymers in order to select for more bioactive factors. One
   potential disadvantage of chitosan is that it degrades in the presence
   of lysozymes (naturally occurring enzymes). But, this can be resisted
   using deacetylation. This is not entirely negative, as the byproducts
   produced through degradation have anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial
   properties. It is important to match the level that cells rely on the
   matrix for structure with degradation.^[134]

Collagen

   [edit]

   Collagen is a family of proteins that makes up the primary structure of
   human connective tissue. It is typically derived from bovine, porcine
   and murine sources. Cellular agriculture overcomes this dependency
   through the use of transgenic organisms that are capable of producing
   the amino acid repeats that make up the collagen. Collagen naturally
   exists as collagen type I. It has been produced as porous hydrogels,
   composites and substrates with topographical cues and biochemical
   properties. Synthetic kinds of collagen have been produced through
   recombinant protein production—collagen type II and III, tropoelastin
   and fibronectin. One challenge with these proteins is that they can not
   be modified post translation. However, an alternative fibrillar protein
   has been isolated in microbes that lack collagen's biochemical cues,
   but has its kind of gene customizability. One focus of recombinant
   collagen production is yield optimization—how it can be produced most
   effectively. Plants, in particular, tobacco look like the best option,
   however, bacteria and yeast are also viable alternatives.^[134]

   Textured soy protein is a soy flour product often used in plant-based
   meat that supports the growth of bovine cells. Its spongy texture
   enables efficient cell seeding and its porosity encourages oxygen
   transfer. Additionally, it degrades during cell differentiation into
   compounds that are beneficial to certain cells.^[136]

Mycelium

   [edit]

   Mycelium are the roots of mushrooms. Altast Foods Co. is using solid
   state fermentation to grow mushroom tissue on mycelium scaffolds. They
   harvest this tissue and use it to create bacon analogs.^[137]

Nanomaterials

   [edit]

   Nanomaterials exhibit unique properties at the nanoscale. London-based
   Biomimetic Solutions is leveraging nanomaterials in order to create
   scaffolds.^[136] Cass Materials in Perth, Australia, is using a dietary
   fibre called Nata de Coco (derived from coconuts) to create
   nanocellulose sponges for their BNC scaffold. Nata de Coco is
   biocompatible, has high porosity, facilitates cell adhesion and is
   biodegradable.^[138]

Spinning

   [edit]

   Immersion Jet Spinning is a method of creating scaffolds by spinning
   polymers into fibres. It was developed by the Parker Group at Harvard.
   Their platform uses centrifugal force to extrude a polymer solution
   through an opening in a rotating reservoir. During extrusion, the
   solution forms a jet that elongates and aligns as it crosses the air
   gap. The jet is directed into a vortex-controlled precipitation bath
   that chemically cross links or precipitates polymer nanofibers.
   Adjusting air gap, rotation and the solution changes the diameter of
   the resulting fibres. This method can spin scaffolds out of PPTA,
   nylon, DNA and nanofiber sheets. A nanofibrous scaffold made from
   alginate and gelatin was able to support the growth of C2C12 cells.
   Rabbit and bovine aortic smooth muscle myoblasts were able to adhere to
   the gelatin fibres.^[142] They formed aggregates on shorter fibres, and
   aligned tissue on the longer ones.^[139] Matrix Meats is using
   electrospinning—a process that uses electric force to turn charged
   polymers into fibres for scaffolds. Their scaffolds allowed meat
   marbling, are compatible with multiple cell lines, and are
   scalable.^[143]

Additive manufacturing

   [edit]
   [250px-Assembly_of_fibrous_muscle%2C_fat%2C_and_vascular_tissues_to_cul
   tured_steak.webp.png] Bioprinting that assembles cell fibers could be
   used to produce a variety of steak-like cultured meat.^[144]

   Another proposed way of structuring muscle tissue is additive
   manufacturing. Such a technique was perfected for industrial
   applications in manufacturing objects made out of plastic, metal, glass
   and other synthetic materials. The most common variation of the process
   involves incrementally depositing a filament in layers onto a bed until
   the object is completed. This method will most likely lend itself best
   to the application of cultured meat as opposed to other types such as
   binder jetting, material jetting or stereolithography that require a
   specific kind of resin or powder.^[citation needed]

   A filament of muscle cells can be printed into a structure meant to
   resemble a finished meat product which can then be further processed
   for cell maturation. This technique has been demonstrated in a
   collaboration between 3D bioprinting solutions and Aleph Farms that
   used additive manufacturing to structure turkey cells on the
   International Space Station.^[145] 3D bioprinting has been used to
   produce steak-like cultured meat, composed of three types of bovine
   cell fibers and with a structure of assembled of cell fibers that is
   similar to original meat.^[144]^[146]

Bioreactors

   [edit]
   [250px-Captura_de_pantalla_2024-07-23_a_las_12.49.37.png] A bioreactor
   beside a glass vessel[250px-Bioreactor_principle.svg.png] A potential
   bioreactor configuration for cultured meat

   Scaffolds are placed inside bioreactors so that cell growth and
   specialization can occur. Bioreactors are large machines similar to
   brewery tanks which expose the cells to a large variety of
   environmental factors that are necessary to promote either
   proliferation or differentiation. The temperature of the bioreactor
   must replicate in vivo conditions. In the case of mammalian cells, this
   requires heating to 37 °C (99 °F). Alternatively, insect cells can be
   grown at room temperature. Most bioreactors are maintained at 5% carbon
   dioxide.^[2]^[147] Cells can be cultivated in either continuous or
   fed-batch systems. The former entails inoculating and harvesting cells
   in a constant process so that there are always cells in the bioreactor.
   Fed-batch systems mean inoculating the cells, culturing them and
   harvesting them in a single period.^[2]

   Stirred tank bioreactors are the most widely used configuration. An
   impeller increases the flow, thereby homogenizing the culture media and
   a diffuser facilitates the exchange of oxygen into the media. This
   system is generally used for suspended cultures but can be used for
   cells that require attachment to another surface if microcarriers are
   included. Fixed bed bioreactors are commonly used for adherent
   cultures. They feature strips of fibres that are packed together to
   form a bed to which cells can attach. Aerated culture media is
   circulated through the bed. In airlift bioreactors, the culture media
   is aerated into a gaseous form using air bubbles which are then
   scattered and dispersed amongst the cells. Perfusion bioreactors are
   common configurations for continuous cultivation. They continuously
   drain media saturated with lactic acid that is void of nutrients and
   fill it with replenished media.^[148]

Challenges

   [edit]

Growth factors

   [edit]

   The culture media is an essential component of in vitro cultivation. It
   is responsible for providing the macromolecules, nutrients and growth
   factors necessary for cell proliferation. Sourcing growth factors is
   one of the most challenging tasks of cellular agriculture.
   Traditionally, it involves the use of fetal bovine serum (FBS) which is
   a blood product extracted from fetal cows. Besides the argument that
   its production is unethical, it also violates the notion that the
   cultured meat is produced independent of the use of animals. It is also
   the most costly constituent of cultured meat, priced at around $1000
   per litre. Furthermore, chemical composition varies greatly depending
   on the animal, so it cannot be uniformly quantified chemically.^[149]
   FBS is employed because it conveniently mimics the process of muscle
   development in vivo. The growth factors needed for tissue development
   are predominantly provided through an animal's bloodstream, and no
   other known fluid can single-handedly deliver all these components.^[2]

   The current alternative is to generate each growth factor individually
   using recombinant protein production. In this process, the genes coding
   for the specific factor are integrated into bacteria which are then
   fermented. Due to the added complexity of this process, it is
   particularly expensive.^[2] Future Fields, a Canadian company focused
   on overcoming the economic and environmental costs of traditional
   growth media, is developing serum-free growth factors from fruit
   flies.^[150]

   The ideal medium would be chemically quantifiable and accessible to
   ensure simplicity in production, cheap and not dependent on
   animals.^[56] It will most likely be derived from plants; and while
   this may reduce the possibility of transmitting infectious agents, it
   may induce allergic reactions in some consumers.^[151] Such culture
   sera may also require modifications specific to the cell line to which
   they are applied. Companies currently invested in developing effective
   plant based culture include Multus Media and Biftek.^[152]^[153]

   The Good Food Institute (GFI) put out a report in 2019 in support of
   the concept that cell-based meat could be produced at the same cost as
   ground beef and in 2021 they commissioned a report from CE Delft on the
   Techno-Economic Analysis of cultivated meat.^[154] Another proposed
   approach is to subject the cell lines to a magnetic field, which can
   stimulate the release of molecules that have regenerative, metabolic,
   anti-inflammatory and immunity-boosting properties, acting as an
   alternative to serum.^[155]

Surface area

   [edit]

   A common challenge to bioreactors and scaffolds is developing system
   configurations that enable all cells to gain exposure to culture media
   while simultaneously optimizing spatial requirements. In the cell
   proliferation phase, prior to the introduction of the scaffold, many
   cell types need to be attached to a surface to support growth. As such,
   cells must be grown in confluent monolayers only one cell thick which
   necessitates a lot of surface area. This poses practical challenges on
   large scales. As such, systems may incorporate microcarriers—small
   spherical beads of glass or other compatible material that are
   suspended in the culture medium. Cells adhere to these microcarriers as
   they would to the sides of the bioreactor, which increases the amount
   of surface area.^[156]

   In the cell differentiation phase, the cells may be seeded to a
   scaffold and so do not require the use of microcarriers. However, in
   these instances, the density of the cells on the scaffold means that
   not all cells have an interface with culture media, leading to cell
   death and necrotic centers within the meat. When muscle is cultivated
   in vivo, this issue is circumvented as the extracellular matrix
   delivers nutrients into the muscle through blood vessels. As such, many
   emerging scaffolds aim to replicate such networks.^[156]

   Similarly, scaffolds must simulate many of the other characteristics of
   the extracellular matrix, most notably porosity, crystallinity,
   degradation, biocompatibility and functionality. Few materials that
   emulate all these characteristics have been identified, leading to the
   possibility of blending different materials with complementary
   properties.^[134]

Research support

   [edit]

   Cellular agriculture research does not have a significant basis of
   academic interest or funding streams.^[26] Consequently, the majority
   of research has been undertaken and funded by independent institutions.
   This is incrementally changing as not for profits drive support and
   interest. Notably, New Harvest has a fellowship program to support
   graduate students and groups at various academic institutions.^[157]
   Additionally, a growing number of governments are funding research in
   cellular agriculture. In August 2020, the Grant Management Services of
   the European Commission awarded a €2.5 million grant to ORF
   Genetics.^[158] That same month, the Japanese Ministry of Economy,
   Trade and Industry granted IntegriCulture $2.2 million through their
   New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization.^[159]

   The European Union's Horizon 2020 R&D funding framework awarded a €2.7
   million grant to a consortium led by BioTech Foods.^[160] In 2021, the
   Spanish government granted €3.7 million for Biotech Foods to
   investigate the potential health benefits of cellular
   agriculture.^[161] The National Science Foundation awarded a $3.55
   million grant to a team of researchers at UC Davis for open-access
   cultured meat research.^[162] Non-profits also drive support and
   interest in the field. Notably, New Harvest has a fellowship program to
   support the research of specific graduate students and groups at
   various academic institutions and the Good Food Institute funds
   open-access research through its Research Grant Program.^[163]

Consumer acceptance

   [edit]

   Consumer acceptance of the product is critical.^[164]^[165] A study
   looking at acceptance of cultured meat in China, India, and the US
   "found high levels of acceptance of clean meat in the three most
   populous countries worldwide."^[166] Several potential factors of
   consumer acceptance of cultured meat have been identified. Healthiness,
   safety, nutritional characteristics, sustainability, taste, and lower
   price, are all contributing factors.^[167]^[168] One study found that
   the use of highly technical language to explain cultured meat led to
   significantly more negative public attitude towards the concept.^[169]
   One study suggested that describing cultured meat in a way that
   emphasizes the final product rather than the production method was an
   effective way to improve acceptance.^[170]

   The use of standardized descriptions would improve future research
   about consumer acceptance of cultured meat. Current studies have often
   reported drastically different rates of acceptance, despite similar
   survey populations.^[171] Lou Cooperhouse, CEO of BlueNalu, shared on
   the Red to Green Podcast that "cell-based" and "cell-cultured" were
   suitable terms to differentiate it from conventional meat whilst being
   clear about the process by which it was made.^[172] There also exists a
   challenge in how to use these descriptions in labelling. For example,
   in the United States there is no overarching federal legislation that
   regulates how cultured meat should be labeled for the consumer. While
   traditional meat producers are attempting to prevent cultured meat
   companies from using the term "meat," cultured meat producers argue
   that the word is necessary for consumer acceptance.^[173]

   Global market acceptance has not been assessed. Studies are attempting
   to determine the current levels of consumer acceptance and identify
   methods to improve this value.^[174] Clear answers are not available,
   although one recent study reported that consumers were willing to pay a
   premium for cultured meat.^[167]^[169]^[170]^[175]^[176]^[177]^[178]
   Low percentages of older adult populations have been reported to show
   acceptance of cultured meat. Green eating behavior, educational status,
   and food business were cited as most important factors for this
   population.^[177] There is also a lack of studies relating the methods
   of producing cultured meat with its taste for the consuming
   public.^[citation needed]

Regulations

   [edit]

   Regulatory matters must also be sorted out. Prior to being available
   for sale, the European Union, Australia, New Zealand, the United
   Kingdom, and Canada require approved novel food applications.
   Additionally, the European Union requires that cultured animal products
   and production must prove safety, by an approved company application,
   as of 1 January 2018.^[179]

Singapore

   [edit]

   In 2020, Singapore became the first country in the world to approve
   cultured meat for sale. The Singapore Food Agency has published
   guidance on its requirements for the safety assessment of novel foods,
   including specific requirements on the information to be submitted for
   approval of cultivated meat products.^[180]

Italy

   [edit]

   In March 2023, Italy's Meloni government approved a draft bill banning
   the production and commercialization of cultivated meat for human and
   animal consumption;^[181]^[182]^[183] this move, which the government
   said was intended to protect food heritage,^[184] was criticized,
   including by scientists, for being at odds with global trends of
   openness and legalization,^[185] as misguided,^[186] and for possibly
   worsening climate change in Italy.^[187]

   By October 2023, it was reported the Italian government had retired the
   draft bill,^[188]^[189]^[190] and withdrew the Technical Regulation
   Information System notification, a procedure aimed at preventing the
   creation of barriers within the European Union's internal market, for
   the bill.^[191] Francesco Lollobrigida, Italy's minister of
   agriculture, said that the withdrawal of the proposed anti-cultured
   meat bill Italy submitted to the European Union "is not a step back",
   which many speculated was because the government wanted to avoid a
   likely rejection by the European Commission. He added that the bill was
   not going to be retired and would move forward.^[192] Italy became the
   first country to ban cultured meat in November 2023, when the
   government approved the bill.^[193]^[194]

US

   [edit]

   Due to the novelty of cultured meat, there are numerous regulations to
   regard cultured meat as safe for consumption through several procedures
   such as evaluation of cell cultivation practices, chemical safety,
   imports, and toxicity tests.^[195]^[196]^[197]^[198] In September 2020,
   the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the United States Department
   of Agriculture (USDA) have agreed to jointly regulate cultured meat.
   Under the agreement, the FDA oversees cell collection, cell banks, and
   cell growth and differentiation, while the USDA oversees the production
   and labeling of food products derived from the cells that are meant for
   human consumption.^[199] Firms that are involved in the culturing of
   animal cells for cultured meat are prompted to contact the FDA in order
   to begin the process of marketing the biological material.^[195]^[197]

   Despite the strict regulations and efforts put in by the FDA and USDA,
   there have been struggles in gaining consumer trust and current
   livestock sector approval on cultured meat, with many states banning
   and restricting the labeling of cultured meat as “meat”.^[200]^[201]

   Several U.S. states, such as Missouri, South Carolina, Texas, and
   Washington, have passed legislation limiting the use of the term meat
   on cultured meat packaging.^[202]^[173]

   Full bans on cultured meat have been enacted in Florida and Alabama: in
   Florida the law makes it a criminal offense to manufacture and
   sell,^[203] and in Alabama cultured meat has been illegal to
   manufacture, sell, or distribute since October 2024.^[204] The
   governments of Arizona, Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia are
   considering similar laws.^[205]

   In August 2024, Upside Foods sued Florida in an attempt to strike down
   their law.^[206]

Differences from conventional meat

   [edit]

Health

   [edit]

   Large-scale production of cultured meat may or may not require
   artificial growth hormones to be added to the culture for meat
   production.^[207]^[208] As cultured meat is grown in a sterile
   environment, there is no need for antibiotics.^[209] Today, the
   widespread use of antibiotics in conventional agriculture is the main
   driver of antibiotic resistance in humans.^[210] According to the World
   Health Organization, antimicrobial resistance represents "an
   increasingly serious threat to global public health that requires
   action across all government sectors and society"^[211] – predicting up
   to 10 million deaths annually by 2050.^[212] Cultured meat could
   provide an effective solution to help mitigate this major risk to human
   health.^[213]

   Researchers have suggested that omega-3 fatty acids could be added to
   cultured meat as a health bonus.^[62] In a similar way, the omega-3
   fatty acid content of conventional meat can be increased by altering
   what the animals are fed.^[214] Research is currently underway in Spain
   to develop cultivated meat with healthier fats, which could reduce
   cholesterol and the risk of colon cancer typically associated with red
   meat consumption.^[215] An issue of Time magazine suggested that the
   cell-cultured process may also decrease exposure of the meat to
   bacteria and disease.^[63]

   Due to the strictly controlled and predictable environment, cultured
   meat production has been compared to vertical farming. Some of its
   proponents have predicted that it will have similar benefits in terms
   of reducing exposure to dangerous chemicals like pesticides and
   fungicides, severe injuries, and wildlife.^[216] There is also a lack
   of research on the comparison on the health effects of production
   cultured meat with the industrial meat or the biologic organic meat
   ways of production.^[citation needed]

Artificiality

   [edit]

   Although cultured meat consists of animal muscle cells, fat and support
   cells, as well as blood vessels,^[217] that are the same as in
   traditional meat, some consumers may find the high-tech production
   process unacceptable. Cultured meat has been described as fake or
   "Frankenmeat".^[218] On the other hand, cultured meat can be produced
   without the artificial hormones, antibiotics, steroids, medicine, and
   GMOs commonly used in factory farmed meat and seafood, though not used
   on organic biologic production. If a cultured meat product is different
   in appearance, taste, smell, texture, or other factors, it may not be
   commercially competitive with conventionally produced meat. The lack of
   bone and cardiovascular system is a disadvantage for dishes where these
   parts make appreciable culinary contributions. The lack of bones and/or
   blood may make many traditional meat preparations, such as buffalo
   wings, more palatable to some people. Furthermore, blood and bones
   could potentially be cultured in the future.^[219]^[220]^[221]

Environment

   [edit]
   See also: Environmental vegetarianism

   Animal production for food is a major cause of air/water pollution and
   carbon emissions.^[222] Significant questions have been raised about
   whether the traditional industry can meet the rapidly increasing
   demands for meat.^[223] Cultured meat may provide an environmentally
   conscious alternative to traditional meat production.^[224] The
   environmental impacts of cultured meat are expected to be significantly
   lower than from animal husbandry.^[225] For every hectare that is used
   for vertical farming and/or cultured meat manufacturing, anywhere
   between 10 and 20 hectares of land may be returned to its natural
   state.^[226] Vertical farms (in addition to cultured meat facilities)
   could exploit methane digesters to generate a portion of its electrical
   needs. Methane digesters could be built on site to transform the
   organic waste generated at the facility into biogas which is generally
   composed of 65% methane. This biogas could be burned to generate
   electricity for the greenhouse or a series of bioreactors.^[227]

   One study reported that cultured meat was "potentially ... much more
   efficient and environmentally-friendly". It generated only 4% of
   greenhouse gas emissions, reduced the energy needs of meat production
   by up to 45%, and required only 2% of the land that the global
   meat/livestock industry does.^[228]^[229] In Tuomisto's life cycle
   analysis claimed that producing 1,000 kg of meat conventionally
   requires "26–33 GJ energy, 367–521 m^3 water, 190–230 m^2 land, and
   emits 1900–2240 kg CO[2]-eq GHG emissions". On the other hand,
   producing the same quantity of meat in vitro has "7–45% lower energy
   use... 78–96% lower GHG emissions, 99% lower land use, and 82–96% lower
   water use".^[230]

   The latest study by independent research firm CE Delft shows
   that—compared with conventional beef—cultured meat may cause up to 92%
   less greenhouse gas emissions if renewable energy is used in the
   production process, 93% less pollution, up to 95% less land use and 78%
   less water.^[231] There are many environmental concerns about intensive
   poultry farming that too can be reduced by cultivating their meat
   instead of farming animals. These concerns include microorganism and
   pharmaceutical-containing manure entering the water and soil, emission
   of greenhouse gasses such as nitrous oxide and methane, and the
   volatilization of manure particles.^[232]

   Skeptic Margaret Mellon of the Union of Concerned Scientists speculates
   that the energy and fossil fuel requirements of large-scale cultured
   meat production may be more environmentally destructive than producing
   food off the land.^[60] S. L. Davis speculated that both vertical
   farming in urban areas and the activity of cultured meat facilities may
   cause relatively little harm to the wildlife that live around the
   facilities.^[233] Dickson Despommier speculated that natural resources
   may be spared from depletion due to vertical farming and cultured
   meat.^[234] One study reported that conventional farming kills ten wild
   animals per hectare each year.^[233]

Role of genetic modification

   [edit]

   Techniques of genetic engineering, such as insertion, deletion,
   silencing, activation, or mutation of a gene, are not required to
   produce cultured meat. Cultured meat production allows the biological
   processes that normally occur within an animal to occur without the
   animal.^[28] Since cultured meat is grown in a controlled, artificial
   environment, some have commented that cultured meat more closely
   resembles hydroponic vegetables, rather than genetically modified
   vegetables.^[235]

   More research is underway on cultured meat, and although cultured meat
   does not require genetic engineering, researchers may employ such
   techniques to improve quality and sustainability. Fortifying cultured
   meat with nutrients such as beneficial fatty acids is one improvement
   that can be facilitated through genetic modification. The same
   improvement can be made without genetic modification, by manipulating
   the conditions of the culture medium.^[236] Genetic modification may be
   able to enhance muscle cell proliferation. The introduction of myogenic
   regulatory factors, growth factors, or other gene products into muscle
   cells may increase production over that of conventional meat.^[236]

   To avoid the use of any animal products, the use of photosynthetic
   algae and cyanobacteria has been proposed to produce the main
   ingredients for the culture media, as opposed to fetal bovine or horse
   serum.^[237] Some researchers propose that the ability of algae and
   cyanobacteria to produce ingredients for culture media can be improved
   with certain technologies, most likely not excluding genetic
   engineering.^[238]

Ethical

   [edit]

   Australian bioethicist Julian Savulescu said, "Artificial meat stops
   cruelty to animals, is better for the environment, could be safer and
   more efficient, and even healthier. We have a moral obligation to
   support this kind of research. It gets the ethical two thumbs
   up."^[239] Animal welfare groups are generally in favor of cultured
   meat, because the culture process does not include a nervous system and
   therefore does not involve pain or infringement of
   rights.^[60]^[240]^[241] Reactions of vegetarians to cultured meat
   vary.^[242] Some feel the cultured meat presented to the public in
   August 2013 was not vegetarian because fetal bovine serum was used in
   the growth medium.^[243] However, since then, cultured meat has been
   grown with a medium that does not involve bovine serum.^[244]
   Philosopher Carlo Alvaro argues that the question of the morality of
   eating in vitro meat has been discussed only in terms of convenience.
   Alvaro proposes a virtue-oriented approach, suggesting that the
   determination to produce cultured meat stems from unvirtuous motives,
   i.e., "lack of temperance and misunderstanding of the role of food in
   human flourishing."^[245]

   Some have proposed independent inquiries into the standards, laws, and
   regulations for cultured meat.^[246] Just as with many other foods,
   cultured meat needs technically sophisticated production methods that
   may be difficult for some communities, meaning they would lack
   self-sufficiency and be dependent on global food corporations.^[247]
   Some projects are focusing on making cellular agriculture accessible to
   all. The Shojinmeat Project, for instance, has a bottom-up approach,
   teaching participants to cultivate DIY cultured meat at home.^[248]

   Establishing a similar parallel with cultured meat, some environmental
   activists claim that adopting a vegetarian diet may be a way of
   focusing on personal actions and righteous gestures rather than
   systemic change. Environmentalist Dave Riley states that "being
   meatless and guiltless seems seductively simple while environmental
   destruction rages around us", and writes that Mollison "insists that
   vegetarianism drives animals from the edible landscape so that their
   contribution to the food chain is lost".^[249]

Religious considerations

   [edit]

   Jewish rabbinical authorities disagree whether cultured meat is kosher,
   meaning acceptable under Jewish law and practice. One factor is the
   nature of the animal from which the cells are sourced, whether it is a
   kosher or non-kosher species and whether, if the cells were taken from
   a dead animal, slaughter in accordance with religious practice had
   taken place prior to the extraction of cells. Most authorities agree
   that if the original cells were taken from a religiously slaughtered
   animal then the meat cultured from it will be kosher.^[250] Depending
   on the nature of the cells, it may be determined to be kosher even when
   taken from a live animal, and some have argued that it would be kosher
   even if coming from non-kosher animals such as pigs.^[251] In 2023 the
   issue of lab meat being a non-meat product or "pareve" has come up for
   debate.^[252] In 2023 the Chief Rabbi of Israel ruled that some types
   of cultured meat are kosher, and if not made to resemble meat, can have
   pareve status.^[253]

   Islamic dietary practices have also been considered.^[254] Amid
   discussion following the presentation of the 2013 Maastricht burger,
   Abdul Qahir Qamar of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy said that
   cultured meat "will not be considered meat from live animals, but will
   be cultured meat." As long as the cells are not from pigs, dogs, and
   other haram animals, the meat would be considered vegetative and
   "similar to yogurt and fermented pickles."^[255]

   Catholicism, which excludes eating meat in certain days along the year
   (Lent, Holy Week), has not pronounced on whether cultivated meat is
   banned (as it happens with meat) or not (as with any other food as
   vegetables or fish). Hinduism typically excludes the consumption of
   beef, such as steak and burgers. Chandra Kaushik, president of the
   Hindu Mahasabha, said about cultured beef that he would "not accept it
   being traded in a marketplace in any form or being used for a
   commercial purpose."^[255]

Economic

   [edit]

   Cultured meat is significantly more costly than conventional meat. In a
   March 2015 interview, Post said that the marginal cost of his team's
   original €250,000 burger was now €8.00. He estimated that technological
   advancements would allow the product to be cost-competitive to
   traditionally sourced beef in approximately ten years.^[256] In 2018,
   Memphis Meats reduced the cost of production to $1,700 per pound.^[257]
   In 2019, Eat Just said it cost about US$50 to produce one chicken
   nugget.^[258] The company's cultured chicken nuggets, now available at
   Singapore restaurant 1880, retail around US$17 as part of a set
   meal;^[259] however, this retail price is below cost. As of 2021, most
   companies report a production cost of $100 or more per meal-sized
   serving.^[260] A 2019 study estimated that, with current technology,
   the actual production cost of cultured meat was over $400,000 per
   kilogram. A 2022 study estimated that, if dramatic advances drove
   medium costs down to $3.74 per liter, large-scale production costs
   might optimistically fall to $63 per kilogram over the next few years.
   The main drivers of cost would be growth medium (accounting for
   $19.7/kg), labor ($17.7/kg), and bioreactor repairs ($5.47/kg).
   Competing with wholesale beef ($6/kg) would require reducing all three
   of these costs.^[261]

Farmers

   [edit]

   A scientific paper published in Front. Sustain. Food Syst. addresses
   the social and economic opportunities and challenges of cultured and
   plant-based meat for rural producers. According to this research,
   cellular agriculture offers "opportunities such as growing crops as
   ingredients for feedstock for cultured meat; raising animals for
   genetic material for cultured meat; producing cultured meat in
   bioreactors at the farm level; transitioning into new sectors; new
   market opportunities for blended and hybrid animal- and alt-meat
   products; and new value around regenerative or high-animal welfare
   farming." Some challenges are also identified, with possible "loss of
   livelihood or income for ranchers and livestock producers and for
   farmers growing crops for animal feed; barriers to transitioning into
   emerging alt-meat sectors; and the possibility of exclusion from those
   sectors." Some farmers already see the potential of cellular
   agriculture. For instance, Illtud Dunsford comes from a long line of
   farmers in Wales and established his cultured meat company Cellular
   Agriculture Ltd in 2016.^[262]

Continuing development

   [edit]

Education

   [edit]

   In 2015, Maastricht University hosted the first International
   Conference on Cultured Meat.^[263] New Harvest^[264]—a 501(c)(3)
   research institute—as well as The Good Food Institute^[265] host annual
   conferences to convene industry leaders, scientists, investors, and
   potential collaborators. The two organizations also fund public
   research and produce educational content. Organizations such as the
   Cellular Agriculture Society and similar organizations in Canada,
   France, Australia, and New Zealand were founded to advocate for
   cultured meat in their respective countries.^[266] Publications such as
   Cell Agri and Protein Report have also provided updates concerning
   technology and business within the field.^[267]^[268]

Research

   [edit]

   Research continues on many fronts, including entomoculture, interactome
   maps of cardiac tissue,^[269] substrate design,^[269] scaffold
   design,^[269] nutritional profile,^[269] reaction kinetics, transport
   phenomena, mass transfer limitations and metabolic stoichiometric
   requirements,^[269] and bioprinting process.^[269]

Accelerators and incubators

   [edit]

   Multiple venture capital firms and accelerator/incubator programs focus
   on assisting cultured technology startups, or plant-based protein
   companies in general. The Big Idea Ventures (BIV) Venture Capital firm
   launched their New Protein Fund to invest in emerging cell and
   plant-based food companies in New York and Singapore. They invested in
   MeliBio, Actual Veggies, Biftek.co, Orbillion Bio, Yoconut, Evo,
   WildFor and Novel Farms.^[270] Indie Bio is a biology oriented
   accelerator program that has invested in Memphis Meats, Geltor, New Age
   Meats and Finless Foods.^[271]

   Cultured meat has often featured in science fiction. The earliest
   mention may be in Two Planets (1897) by Kurd Lasswitz, where "synthetic
   meat" is one of the varieties of synthetic food introduced on Earth by
   Martians. Other notable books mentioning artificial meat include
   Methuselah's Children (1941) by Robert A. Heinlein; Ashes, Ashes (1943)
   by René Barjavel; The Space Merchants (1952) by Frederik Pohl and C.M.
   Kornbluth; The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (1980) by Douglas
   Adams; Le Transperceneige (Snowpiercer) (1982) by Jacques Lob and
   Jean-Marc Rochette; Neuromancer (1984) by William Gibson; Oryx and
   Crake (2003) by Margaret Atwood; Deadstock (2007) by Jeffrey Thomas;
   Accelerando (2005) by Charles Stross; Ware Tetralogy by Rudy Rucker;
   Divergent (2011) by Veronica Roth; and the Vorkosigan Saga (1986–2018)
   by Lois McMaster Bujold.^[citation needed]

   In film, artificial meat has featured prominently in Giulio Questi's
   1968 drama La morte ha fatto l'uovo (Death Laid an Egg) and Claude
   Zidi's 1976 comedy L'aile ou la cuisse (The Wing or the Thigh).
   "Man-made" chickens also appear in David Lynch's 1977 surrealist
   horror, Eraserhead. Most recently, it was also featured prominently as
   the central theme of the movie Antiviral (2012).^[citation needed] The
   Starship Enterprise from the TV and movie franchise Star Trek
   apparently provides a synthetic meat,^[272] although crews from The
   Next Generation and later use replicators.^[citation needed] In the ABC
   sitcom Better Off Ted (2009–2010), the episode "Heroes" features Phil
   (Jonathan Slavin) and Lem (Malcolm Barrett) trying to grow cowless
   beef.^[273]

   In the movie Galaxy Quest during the dinner scene, Tim Allen's
   character refers to his steak tasting like "real Iowa beef".^[citation
   needed] In the videogame Project Eden, the player characters
   investigate a cultured meat company called Real Meat.^[citation needed]
   In The Expanse, "vat-grown" meat is produced to feed the people who
   live on spaceships/space stations away from Earth, due to the
   exorbitant cost of importing real meat.^[citation needed] Cultured meat
   was a subject on an episode of The Colbert Report on 17 March
   2009.^[274]

   In February 2014, a biotech startup called BiteLabs ran a campaign to
   generate popular support for artisanal salami made with meat cultured
   from celebrity tissue samples.^[275] The campaign became popular on
   Twitter, where users tweeted at celebrities asking them to donate
   muscle cells to the project.^[276] Media reactions to BiteLabs
   variously identified the startup as a satire on startup culture,^[277]
   celebrity culture,^[278] or as a discussion prompt on bioethical
   concerns.^[279] While BiteLabs claimed to be inspired by the success of
   Sergey Brin's burger, the company is seen as an example of critical
   design rather than an actual business venture.^[citation needed]

   In late 2016, cultured meat was involved in a case in the episode "How
   The Sausage Is Made" of CBS show Elementary.^[280] Cultured meat was
   profiled in the 2020 Canadian documentary film Meat the Future.^[281]
   In the 2020 video game Cyberpunk 2077, multiple cultured meat products
   are for sale, due to the high cost of natural meat. This includes
   "EEZYBEEF", made from in vitro cultured muscle cells taken from cattle,
   and the flatworm culture based "Orgiatic" which comes in several
   flavors.^[citation needed]

Related processes

   [edit]

Fermentation

   [edit]

   Acellular agriculture is producing animal products synthesized from
   non-living material. Such products include milk, honey, eggs, cheese,
   and gelatin which are made of various proteins rather than cells.^[282]
   These proteins must be fermented much like in recombinant protein
   production, alcohol brewing and the generation of many plant-based
   products like tofu, tempeh and sauerkraut.^[283]
   [330px-Impossible_Burger_-_Gott%27s_Roadside-_2018_-_Stierch.jpg] The
   Impossible Burger was made with fermented heme proteins.

   Proteins are coded for by specific genes, the genes coding for the
   protein of interest are synthesized into a plasmid—a closed loop of
   double helical genetic information. This plasmid, called recombinant
   DNA, is then inserted into a bacterial specimen. For this to happen,
   the bacteria needs to be competent (i.e. able to accept foreign,
   extracellular DNA) and able to horizontally transfer genes (i.e.
   integrate the foreign genes into its own DNA). Horizontal gene transfer
   is significantly more challenging in eukaryotic organisms than
   prokaryotic organisms because the former have both a cell membrane and
   a nuclear membrane which the plasmid needs to penetrate whereas
   prokaryotic organisms only have a cell membrane. For this reason,
   prokaryotic bacteria are often favoured. In order to make such a
   bacteria temporarily competent, it can be exposed to a salt such as
   calcium chloride, which neutralizes the negative charges on the cell
   membrane's phosphate heads as well as the negative charges on the
   plasmid to prevent the two from repelling. The bacteria can incubate in
   warm water, opening large pores on the cell surface through which the
   plasmid can enter.^[284]

   Next, the bacteria is fermented in sugar, which encourages it to grow
   and duplicate. In the process it expresses its DNA as well as the
   transferred plasmid resulting in protein.^[citation needed] Finally,
   the solution is purified to separate out the residual protein. This can
   be done by introducing an antibody raised against the protein of
   interest that will kill bacteria cells that do not contain the protein.
   Through centrifugation, the solution can be spun around an axis with
   sufficient force to separate solids from liquids. Alternatively it
   could be soaked in a buffered ionic solution that employs osmosis to
   leach the water from bacteria and kill them.^[285]
