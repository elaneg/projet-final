   Modern form of ostracism

   Cancel culture, also called call-out culture, is a cultural phenomenon
   in which people criticize an individual thought to have acted or spoken
   in an unacceptable manner, and call (typically over social media) for
   the target to be ostracized, boycotted, shunned or
   fired.^[1]^[2]^[3]^[4] This shunning may extend to social or
   professional circles—whether on social media or in person—with most
   high-profile incidents involving celebrities.^[5] Those subject are
   said to have been "canceled".^[6]^[7]^[a] While the careers of some
   public figures have been impacted by boycotts—widely described as
   "cancellation"—others who complained of cancellation successfully
   continued their careers.^[8]^[9]

   The term "cancel culture" came into circulation in 2018 and has mostly
   negative connotations.^[7] Some critics argue that cancel culture has a
   chilling effect on public discourse, that it is unproductive, that it
   does not bring real social change, that it causes intolerance, or that
   it amounts to cyberbullying.^[10]^[11] Others argue that the term is
   used to attack efforts to promote accountability or give
   disenfranchised people a voice, and to attack language that is itself
   free speech. Still others question whether cancel culture is an actual
   phenomenon,^[12] arguing that boycotting existed long before the origin
   of the term "cancel culture".^[11]^[13]^[14]

Origins

   The 1981 Chic album Take It Off includes the song "Your Love Is
   Cancelled", which compares a breakup to the cancellation of TV shows.
   The song was written by Nile Rodgers following a bad date Rodgers had
   with a woman who expected him to misuse his celebrity status on her
   behalf. "Your Love Is Cancelled" inspired screenwriter Barry Michael
   Cooper to include a reference to a woman being canceled in the 1991
   film New Jack City.^[15] This usage introduced the term to
   African-American Vernacular English, where it became more common.^[16]

   By 2015, the concept of canceling had become widespread on Black
   Twitter to refer to a personal decision, sometimes seriously and
   sometimes in jest, to stop supporting a person or work.^[15]^[17]^[18]
   According to Jonah Engel Bromwich of The New York Times, this usage of
   the word "cancellation" indicates "total disinvestment in something
   (anything)".^[3]^[19] After numerous cases of online shaming gained
   wide notoriety, the use of the term "cancellation" increased to
   describe a widespread, outraged, online response to a single
   provocative statement, against a single target.^[20] Over time, as
   isolated instances of cancellation became more frequent and the mob
   mentality more apparent, commentators began seeing a "culture" of
   outrage and cancellation.^[21]

   In October 2017, sexual assault allegations against film producer
   Harvey Weinstein led to the cancellation of his projects, his expulsion
   from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and legal
   consequences, including a conviction on charges of rape and sexual
   assault. These events contributed to the rise of the #MeToo movement,
   where individuals shared their own allegations of sexual assault,
   leading to the cancellation of the careers of those accused.^[22] In
   November 2017, comedian Louis C.K. admitted to sexual misconduct
   allegations and, as a result, his shows were canceled, distribution
   deals were terminated, and he was dropped by his agency and management.
   After a period away from show business, Louis C.K. returned to work in
   2018 and won a Grammy award in 2022. However, many people in the
   entertainment industry said that it was inappropriate to support his
   career or award him a Grammy due to his past misconduct.^[23]^[24]
   [250px-2010-_Cancel_culture_-_Google_Trends.svg.png] Google searches
   for the phrase "cancel culture" accelerated in 2020, while searches
   including broader equivalent terms accelerated in 2021.^[25]

   Conversations about "cancel culture" increased in late 2019.^[26]^[27]
   In the 2020s, the phrase became a shorthand nom de guerre employed by
   spectators to refer to what they perceived to be disproportionate
   reactions to politically incorrect speech.^[28] In 2020, Ligaya Mishan
   wrote in The New York Times: "The term is shambolically applied to
   incidents both online and off that range from vigilante justice to
   hostile debate to stalking, intimidation and harassment. ... Those who
   embrace the idea (if not the precise language) of canceling seek more
   than pat apologies and retractions, although it's not always clear
   whether the goal is to right a specific wrong or redress a larger
   imbalance of power."^[29]^[30] "Call-out culture" has been in use as
   part of the #MeToo movement.^[31] The #MeToo movement encouraged women
   and men to call out their abusers on a forum where the accusations
   would be heard, especially against very powerful individuals.^[11]

Academic, philosophical, and legal perspectives

   An article written by Pippa Norris, a professor at Harvard University,
   states that the controversies surrounding cancel culture are between
   those who argue it gives a voice to those in marginalized communities
   and those who argue that cancel culture is dangerous because it
   prevents free speech and/or the opportunity for open debate. Norris
   emphasizes the role of social media in contributing to the rise of
   cancel culture.^[32] Additionally, online communications studies have
   demonstrated the intensification of cultural wars through activists
   that are connected through digital and social networking sites.^[33]
   Norris also mentions that the spiral of silence theory may contribute
   to why people are hesitant to voice their minority views on social
   media sites and fear that their views and opinions, specifically
   political opinions, will be chastised because their views violate the
   majority group's norms and understanding.^[34]

   In the book The Coddling of the American Mind (2018), social
   psychologist Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff, president of the
   Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, argue that call-out
   culture arises on college campuses from what they term "safetyism"—a
   moral culture in which people are unwilling to make tradeoffs demanded
   by the practical or moral concerns of others.^[35]^[36]^[37] Keith
   Hampton, professor of media studies at Michigan State University,
   contends that the practice contributes to political polarization in the
   United States but does not lead to changes in opinion.^[38] Cancel
   culture has been described by media studies scholar Eve Ng as "a
   collective of typically marginalized voices 'calling out' and
   emphatically expressing their censure of a powerful figure".^[39]
   Cultural studies scholar Frances E. Lee states that call-out culture
   leads to self-policing of "wrong, oppressive, or inappropriate"
   opinions.^[40]^[41] According to Lisa Nakamura, University of Michigan
   professor of media studies, canceling someone is a form of "cultural
   boycott" and cancel culture is the "ultimate expression of agency",
   which is "born of a desire for control [as] people have limited power
   over what is presented to them on social media" and a need for
   "accountability which is not centralized".^[3]^[42]^[43]

   Some academics have proposed alternatives and improvements to cancel
   culture. Clinical counsellor Anna Richards, who specializes in conflict
   mediation, says that "learning to analyze our own motivations when
   offering criticism" helps call-out culture work productively.^[44]
   Professor Joshua Knobe, of the Philosophy Department at Yale, contends
   that public denunciation is not effective, and that society is too
   quick to pass judgement against those they view as public offenders or
   personae non gratae. Knobe says that these actions have the opposite
   effect on individuals, and that it is best to bring attention to the
   positive actions in which most of society participates.^[45] Former
   U.S. Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia wrote in a 2021 Harvard Journal
   of Law and Public Policy article that cancel culture is a form of free
   speech, and is therefore protected under the First Amendment to the
   U.S. Constitution. According to Scalia, cancel culture can interfere
   with the right to counsel, since some lawyers would not be willing to
   risk their personal and professional reputation on controversial
   topics.^[46] In 2023, American conservatives and anti-trans activists
   engaged in a boycott of Bud Light over its hiring of transgender TikTok
   personality Dylan Mulvaney.^[47] The incident is seen an example of
   cancel culture and consumer backlash. The Harvard Business Review cited
   the incident as an example of an attempt to "resonate with younger,
   more socially-conscious audiences", but that it "generated downstream
   adjustments from retailers and distributors" that negatively hurt the
   product's performance. It highlighted the incident as making consumer
   brand marketing departments fearful of taking a stand on social
   issues.^[48]^[49]

   Ng defines cancel culture as "the withdrawal of any kind of support
   (viewership, social media follows, purchases of products endorsed by
   the person, etc.) for those who are assessed to have said or done
   something unacceptable or highly problematic, generally from a social
   justice perspective especially alert to sexism, heterosexism,
   homophobia, racism, bullying, and related issues."^[50] There are
   different perspectives on the morality of cancellations. On the one
   hand, there is the view that cancel culture imposes punishments that
   are not proportional to the offenses or alleged offenses.^[51] This is
   closely related to John Stuart Mill's criticism of public shaming; he
   argued in On Liberty that society "practises a social tyranny more
   formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not
   usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of
   escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and
   enslaving the soul itself."^[52] Martha Nussbaum similarly says that
   cancel culture represents the "justice of the mob", but this alleged
   justice is not "deliberative, impartial or neutral."^[53] On the other
   hand, there are those who defend the value of shaming as constructive,
   if done right; people who defend this view maintain that cancel culture
   often shames people counter-productively but that it can be tweaked or
   altered in order to be a valuable tool for people's improvement.^[54]
   For instance, holding people accountable for things that they have done
   wrong can be a powerful way of correcting bad behavior, but it has to
   be paired with a belief in the possibility of redemption.^[55] People
   who take this approach often agree with Plato that shame is an
   important feeling that can lead to moral improvements.^[56] Everyone in
   this debate agrees that it is important to avoid what Nussbaum calls a
   "spoiled identity": to have a spoiled identity is to have the public
   image of someone who is irredeemable and unwelcome in a community.^[57]

Reactions

   The expression "cancel culture" has mostly negative connotations and is
   used in debates on free speech and censorship.^[28]^[58]

Criticism

   In a speech at the Obama Foundation's annual summit in 2020, former
   U.S. President Barack Obama criticized the role of "call-out culture"
   and "wokeness" among young activists on social media.^[59]^[60] U.S.
   President Donald Trump criticized "cancel culture" in a speech in July
   2020, comparing it to totalitarianism and saying that it is a political
   weapon used to punish and shame dissenters by driving them from their
   jobs and demanding submission. He was subsequently criticized as being
   hypocritical for having attempted to cancel a number of people and
   companies in the past himself.^[61] Trump made similar claims during
   the 2020 Republican National Convention when he stated that the goal of
   cancel culture is to make decent Americans live in fear of being fired,
   expelled, shamed, humiliated, and driven from society.^[34]

   Pope Francis said that cancel culture is "a form of ideological
   colonization, one that leaves no room for freedom of expression",
   saying that it "ends up cancelling all sense of
   identity".^[62]^[63]^[64] Patrisse Khan-Cullors, the co-founder of the
   Black Lives Matter movement, states that social activism does not just
   involve going online or going to a protest to call someone out, but is
   work entailing strategy sessions, meetings, and getting petitions
   signed.^[11] British prime minister Rishi Sunak included cancel
   culture, where one group "are trying to impose their views on the rest
   of us", among the contemporary dangers of the modern world.^[65]

   Philosopher Slavoj Žižek states that "cancel culture, with its implicit
   paranoia, is a desperate and obviously self-defeating attempt to
   compensate for the very real violence and intolerance that sexual
   minorities have long suffered. But it is a retreat into a cultural
   fortress, a pseudo-'safe space' whose discursive fanaticism merely
   strengthens the majority's resistance to it."^[66] Lisa Nakamura, a
   professor at the University of Michigan, describes cancel culture as "a
   cultural boycott" and says it provides a culture of accountability.^[3]
   Meredith Clark, an assistant professor at the University of Virginia,
   states that cancel culture gives power to disenfranchised voices.^[11]
   Osita Nwanevu, a staff writer for The New Republic, states that people
   are threatened by cancel culture because it is a new group of young
   progressives, minorities, and women who have "obtained a seat at the
   table" and are debating matters of justice and etiquette.^[67]

Open letter

   Main article: A Letter on Justice and Open Debate

   Dalvin Brown, writing in USA Today, has described an open letter signed
   by 153 public figures and published in Harper's Magazine as marking a
   "high point" in the debate on the topic.^[28] The letter set out
   arguments against "an intolerance of opposing views, a vogue for public
   shaming and ostracism, and the tendency to dissolve complex policy
   issues in a blinding moral certainty".^[68]^[69]^[70] A response
   letter, "A More Specific Letter on Justice and Open Debate", was signed
   by over 160 people in academia and media. It criticized the Harper's
   letter as a plea to end cancel culture by successful professionals with
   large platforms who wanted to exclude others who have been "canceled
   for generations". The writers ultimately stated that the Harper's
   letter was intended to further silence already marginalized people.
   They wrote: "It reads as a caustic reaction to a diversifying
   industry—one that's starting to challenge diversifying norms that have
   protected bigotry."^[71]^[72]

Criticism of "cancel culture" as a concept

   A number of professors, politicians, journalists,^[73]^[74]^[75] and
   activists have questioned the validity of cancel culture as an actual
   phenomenon.^[9] Connor Garel, writing for Vice, states that cancel
   culture "rarely has any tangible or meaningful effect on the lives and
   comfortability of the cancelled".^[8] Danielle Kurtzleben, a political
   reporter for NPR, wrote in 2021 that overuse of the phrase "cancel
   culture" in American politics, particularly by Republicans, has made it
   "arguably background noise". Per Kurtzleben and others, the term has
   undergone semantic bleaching to lose its original meaning.^[76]

   Historian C. J. Coventry argues that the term is incorrectly applied,
   and that the label has been used to avoid accountability for historical
   instances of injustice.^[77]^[b] Another historian, David Olusoga, made
   a similar argument, and argued that the phenomenon of cancellation is
   not limited to the left.^[14]^[c] Indigenous governance professor and
   activist Pamela Palmater writes in Maclean's magazine that "cancel
   culture is the dog whistle term used by those in power who don't want
   to be held accountable for their words and actions—often related to
   racism, misogyny, homophobia or the abuse and exploitation of
   others."^[13]

   Sarah Manavis wrote for the New Statesman magazine, "For the better
   part of the last decade, we have given a label to something that has
   existed for the length of human history. Some might call it criticism,
   others might call it backlash." Quoting Jon Ronson's remark that the
   term 'cancel culture' is 'not useful at all' since it "encompass[es]
   wildly different people and situations", Manavis argued that "Ronson
   himself believes" that the "public shaming of civilians" which Ronson
   wrote of in So You've Been Publicly Shamed "doesn’t apply" to the
   notion of cancel culture, since public shaming of "non-famous people"
   is not essentially about lack of "free speech", but about "how little
   power normal people have".^[12]

Consequence culture

   Some media commentators including LeVar Burton and Sunny Hostin have
   stated that "cancel culture" should be renamed "consequence
   culture".^[78] The terms have different connotations: "cancel culture"
   focusing on the effect whereby discussion is limited by a desire to
   maintain one certain viewpoint, whereas "consequence culture" focuses
   on the idea that those who write or publish opinions or make statements
   should bear some responsibility for the effects of these on
   people.^[79]

American public opinion

   A survey conducted in September 2020 on 10,000 Americans by Pew
   Research Center asked a series of different questions in regard to
   cancel culture, specifically on who has heard of the term cancel
   culture and how Americans define cancel culture.^[80] At that time, 44%
   of Americans said that they have at least heard a fair amount about the
   new phrase, while 22% have heard a great deal and 32% said they have
   heard nothing at all.^[80] 43% Americans aged 18–29 have heard a great
   deal about cancel culture, compared to only 12% of Americans over the
   age of 65 who say they have heard a great deal.^[80] Additionally,
   within that same study, the 44% of Americans who had heard a great deal
   about cancel culture, were then asked how they defined cancel culture.
   49% of those Americans state that it describes actions people take to
   hold others accountable, 14% describe cancel culture as censorship of
   speech or history, and 12% define it as mean-spirited actions taken to
   cause others harm.^[80] It was found that men were more likely to have
   heard or know of cancel culture, and that those who identify with the
   Democratic Party (46%) are no more likely to know the term than those
   in the Republican Party (44%).^[80]

   A poll of American registered voters conducted by Morning Consult in
   July 2020 showed that cancel culture, defined as "the practice of
   withdrawing support for (or canceling) public figures and companies
   after they have done or said something considered objectionable or
   offensive", was common: 40% of respondents said they had withdrawn
   support from public figures and companies, including on social media,
   because they had done or said something considered objectionable or
   offensive, with 8% having engaged in this often. Behavior differed
   according to age, with a majority (55%) of voters 18 to 34 years old
   saying they have taken part in cancel culture, while only about a third
   (32%) of voters over 65 said they had joined a social media
   pile-on.^[81] Attitude towards the practice was mixed, with 44% of
   respondents saying they disapproved of cancel culture, 32% who
   approved, and 24% who did not know or had no opinion. Furthermore, 46%
   believed cancel culture had gone too far, with only 10% thinking it had
   not gone far enough. Additionally, 53% believed that people should
   expect social consequences for expressing unpopular opinions in public,
   such as those that may be construed as deeply offensive to other
   people.^[82]

   A March 2021 poll by Harvard University's Center for American Political
   Studies and the Harris Poll found that 64% of respondents viewed "a
   growing cancel culture" as a threat to their freedom, while the other
   36% did not. 36% of respondents said that cancel culture is a big
   problem, 32% called it a moderate problem, 20% called it a small
   problem, and 13% said it is not a problem. 54% said they were concerned
   that if they expressed their opinions online, they would be banned or
   fired, while the other 46% said they were not concerned.^[83] A
   November 2021 Hill/HarrisX poll found that 71% of registered voters
   strongly or somewhat felt that cancel culture went too far, with
   similar numbers of Republicans (76%), Democrats (70%), and independents
   (68%) saying so.^[84] The same poll found that 69% of registered voters
   felt that cancel culture unfairly punishes people for their past
   actions or statements, compared to 31% who said it did not. Republicans
   were more likely to agree with the statement (79%), compared to
   Democrats (65%) and independents (64%).^[85]

   In a January 2022 Knight-Ipsos study involving 4,000 participants, most
   Americans surveyed said that some speech should be prohibited.
   Specifically, they stated that "a variety of private and public
   institutions should prohibit racist speech". However, most also noted
   that these same institutions should not ban political views that are
   offensive.^[86] A March 2022 New York Times/Siena College survey of
   1,000 Americans found that 84 percent of adults said it is a "very
   serious" or "somewhat serious" problem that some Americans do not speak
   freely in everyday situations because of fear of retaliation or harsh
   criticism. The survey also found that 46 percent of respondents said
   they felt less free to talk about politics compared to a decade ago,
   and that only 34 percent of Americans said they believed that all
   Americans enjoyed freedom of speech
   completely.^[87]^[88]^[89]^[90]^[91]

Usage by the political right

   See also: Disciplinary actions for commentary on the assassination of
   Charlie Kirk

   Activists on the right have also attempted to and sometimes succeeded
   in canceling various people.

   Historian Nicole Hemmer finds historical "cancel culture" on the right
   before the term was coined, in various movements. McCarthyism and the
   Lavender Scare of the 1940s and 1950s aimed to get people suspected of
   communist sympathies or homosexuality fired from their government or
   private-sector jobs, including the entertainment industry through the
   Hollywood blacklist. The Save Our Children campaign in the late 1970s
   was a movement to legalize discrimination on the basis of sexual
   orientation legal, and ban gay and lesbian people from school
   employment. Conservatives angry at various comments were able to secure
   the cancellation of Bill Mahr's show Politically Incorrect, and the
   resignation of Van Jones and Shirley Sherrod from the Obama
   Administration. Attempts to ban LGBTQ-related books (e.g. Heather Has
   Two Mommies, And Tango Makes Three) in the 1990s and 2000s have
   continued in the 2020s with groups like Moms for Liberty.^[92]

   The right has also been criticized for supporting cancel culture in
   regards to Israel and Palestine. For example, during the Gaza war,
   Republicans held Congress hearings in which they accused university
   leaders of not doing enough to silence what they perceived as
   antisemitic speech on campus.^[93] In another example, New York
   University withheld the diploma of graduating senior Logan Rozos, in
   retaliation for his criticism of US support for the genocide in Gaza
   during a graduation speech.^[94]^[95] Cancel culture directed at
   pro-Palestine activists, also known as the Palestine exception to free
   speech, is engaged in by some activists who present themselves as
   defenders of free speech.^[96] Other critics of cancel culture have
   also supported book bans in school and public libraries or censorship
   of school curriculums.^[97]

   In the aftermath of the assassination of Charlie Kirk, some
   conservatives who had previously criticized cancel culture pushed for
   the firing of people who criticized Kirk after his
   death.^[98]^[99]^[100] Vice President JD Vance called on Americans to
   report those allegedly celebrating Kirk's killing to their employers
   and promised to use the federal government to investigate and punish
   liberal organizations and donors. Adam Goldstein of the Foundation for
   Individual Rights and Expression described the shift as a form of
   right-wing cancel culture, noting that people were being targeted for
   simply quoting Kirk or failing to mourn his passing adequately,
   comparing government involvement to McCarthyism.^[101] The New York
   Times described the campaign as morphing into "a conservative version
   of the cancel culture that only a few years ago was wielded by the
   American left",^[102] and evidence of the rise of a "woke right".^[103]
   Some conservative voices also objected to the Trump administration's
   efforts to police speech surrounding Kirk's death, with The Wall Street
   Journal running an editorial saying: "The squeeze on Disney looks to be
   a case of cancel culture on the right."^[100]^[104]

In popular media

     * The American animated television series South Park mocked cancel
       culture with its own "#CancelSouthPark" campaign;^[105]^[106]^[107]
       in promotion of the show's twenty-second season (2018).^[108] In
       the season's third episode, "The Problem with a Poo", there are

Notes

    1. ^ Merriam-Webster notes that to "cancel", in this context, means
       "to stop giving support to that person".^[6] Dictionary.com, in its
       pop-culture dictionary, defines cancel culture as "withdrawing
       support for (canceling) public figures and companies after they
       have done or said something considered objectionable or
       offensive."^[7]
    2. ^ "While I agree that the line between debate and suppression is
       one that occasionally gets crossed by the so-called left wing, it
       is almost invariably true that the real cancel culture is
       perpetrated by those who have embraced the term. If you look
       through Australian history, as well as European and American
       history, you will find countless examples of people speaking out
       against injustice and being persecuted in return. I can think of a
       number of people in our own time who are being persecuted by
       supposedly democratic governments for revealing uncomfortable
       information."^[77]
    3. ^ "Unlike some on the left, I have never doubted that 'cancel
       culture' exists ... The great myth about cancel culture, however,
       is that it exists only on the left. For the past 40 years,
       rightwing newspapers have ceaselessly fought to delegitimize and
       ultimately cancel our national broadcaster [the BBC], motivated by
       financial as well as political ambitions."^[14]
