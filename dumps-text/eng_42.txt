What is Research Culture?

   Research cultures are built on the values, expectations and behaviours
   that shape how we support, deliver and communicate our research.

   We build and maintain our research cultures through the actions,
   interactions, behaviours and processes that we all encounter and
   perform while undertaking or supporting research.  These cultures are
   felt and influenced by us at individual, team, department, university
   and wider discipline level.  Research cultures can be experienced
   differently at each level and within each discipline, which is why our
   approach acknowledges that we experience and contribute to multiple
   research cultures, and that a University the size of Edinburgh will
   have many research cultures.


     Research culture encompasses the behaviours, values, expectations,
     attitudes and norms of our research communities. It influences
     researchers’ career paths and determines the way that research is
     conducted and communicated.

     Research Culture | Royal Society

     We want to help build a better research culture – one that is
     creative, inclusive and honest. Current practices prioritise outputs
     at all costs, and this is damaging people’s wellbeing and
     undermining the quality of research. Expectations around how
     research is conducted need to be reimagined.

     Research Culture | Wellcome

   In recent years funders and policy makers have increased their interest
   in research culture, a broad agenda that covers individual and
   organisational culture; equality, diversity and inclusion; management
   practices and policies; research ethics and integrity; open
   research; research impact and how all these areas inter-relate
   with each other.  Although the term 'research culture' has gained
   prominence recently, University of Edinburgh has been engaged in
   improving aspects of our research culture for many years, for example
   through our committments to our Athena SWAN action plans and our Open
   Research Roadmap.

Research Cultures Action Plan

   In February 2023, we published our first University of Edinburgh
   Research Cultures Action Plan.  More details can be found at the link
