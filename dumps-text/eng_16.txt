   A culture minister or a heritage minister is a common cabinet position
   in governments. The culture minister is typically responsible for
   cultural policy, which often includes arts policy (direct and indirect
   support to artists and arts organizations) and measures to protect the
   national heritage of a country and cultural expression of a country or
   subnational region. This responsibility usually manifests in the
   accompanying ministry (also called a "department"), governing the
   following:
     * an official registry of protected historic sites and other sites of
       cultural importance
     * maintaining national archives of cultural work, including public
       museums, galleries and libraries
     * creating a department or ministry of culture or arts
     * creating arts councils, which disburse funding to artists and arts
       organization
     * providing funding and other forms of support to artists and arts
       institutions.^[1]

   In some countries or subnational jurisdictions (e.g., provinces,
   regions, Länder), the minister of culture may also be responsible for
   sport, youth issues, or tourism (e.g., in Turkey). In a few cases, the
   minister of culture is also responsible for foreign affairs (e.g., in
   Scotland), education (e.g., Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia), science and
   technology policy (e.g., Japan), communications/media (Singapore, UK),
   or a geographical area associated with national heritage (e.g.,
   Ireland).

Terminology

   [edit]

   A culture minister may also be called a cultural minister, minister of
   culture, minister of cultural affairs, minister of arts, minister of
   heritage, secretary of culture or secretary of state of culture.
