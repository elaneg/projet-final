   Political culture describes how culture impacts politics. Every
   political system is embedded in a particular political culture.^[1]
   Political culture is what the people, the voters, the electorates
   believe and do based on their understanding of the political system in
   which they have found themselves. These may be regarded as being bad or
   good placed side by side with global best practices or norms.

Definition

   [edit]

   Gabriel Almond defines it as "the particular pattern of orientations
   toward political actions in which every political system is
   embedded".^[1]

   Lucian Pye's definition is that "Political culture is the set of
   attitudes, beliefs, and sentiments, which give order and meaning to a
   political process and which provide the underlying assumptions and
   rules that govern behavior in the political system".^[1]

   María Eugenia Vázquez Semadeni defines political culture as "the set of
   discourses and symbolic practices by means of which both individuals
   and groups articulate their relationship to power, elaborate their
   political demands and put them at stake."^[2]

Analysis

   [edit]

   The limits of a particular political culture are based on subjective
   identity.^[1] The most common form of such identity today is the
   national identity, and hence nation states set the typical limits of
   political cultures.^[1] The socio-cultural system, in turn, gives
   meaning to a political culture through shared symbols and rituals (such
   as a national independence day) which reflect common values.^[1] This
   may develop into a civil religion. The values themselves can be more
   hierarchical or egalitarian, and will set the limits to political
   participation, thereby creating a basis for legitimacy.^[1] They are
   transmitted through socialization, and shaped by shared historical
   experiences which form the collective or national memory.^[1]
   Intellectuals will continue to interpret the political culture through
   political discourse in the public sphere.^[1] Indeed, elite political
   culture is more consequential than mass-level.^[3]

Elements

   [edit]

   Trust is a major factor in political culture, as its level determines
   the capacity of the state to function.^[3] Postmaterialism is the
   degree to which political culture is concerned with issues which are
   not of immediate physical or material concern, such as human rights and
   environmentalism.^[1] Religion has also an impact on political
   culture.^[3]

Classifications

   [edit]

   Different typologies of political culture have been proposed.

Almond & Verba

   [edit]

   Gabriel Almond and Sidney Verba in The Civic Culture outlined three
   pure types of political culture based on level and type of political
   participation and the nature of people's attitudes toward politics:
     * Parochial – Where citizens are only remotely aware of the presence
       of central government, and live their lives near enough regardless
       of the decisions taken by the state, distant and unaware of
       political phenomena. They have neither knowledge nor interest in
       politics. This type of political culture is in general congruent
       with a traditional political structure.
     * Subject – Where citizens are aware of central government, and are
       heavily subjected to its decisions with little scope for dissent.
       The individual is aware of politics, its actors and institutions.
       It is affectively oriented towards politics, yet it is on the
       "downward flow" side of the politics. In general congruent with a
       centralized authoritarian structure.
     * Participant – Citizens are able to influence the government in
       various ways and they are affected by it. The individual is
       oriented toward the system as a whole, to both the political and
       administrative structures and processes (to both the input and
       output aspects). In general congruent with a democratic political
       structure.

   Almond and Verba wrote that these types of political culture can
   combine to create the civic culture, which mixes the best elements of
   each.

Elazar

   [edit]

   Daniel J. Elazar identified three kinds of political culture:^[3]
     * Individualistic culture – In which politics is a marketplace
       between individuals seeking to maximize their self-interest, with
       minimal community involvement and opposition to the government, as
       well as a high degree of patronage. See also: Neopatrimonialism.
     * Moralistic culture – Whereby government is seen as important and as
       a way to improve peoples' lives.
     * Traditionalistic culture – One which seeks to preserve the status
       quo under which elites have all the power and citizen participation
       is not expected.

Huntington

   [edit]
   See also: Clash of Civilizations

   Samuel P. Huntington classified political cultures according to
   civilizations on the basis of geography and history:^[3]
     * Western civilization
     * Japanese civilization
     * Islamic civilization
     * Hindu civilization
     * Slavic-Orthodox civilization
     * Latin American civilization
     * Chinese civilization
     * African civilization

Inglehart

   [edit]

   Ronald Inglehart proposes that political culture can dictate political
   systems, and points out a correlation between Protestantism (or more
   generally societies with high Secular-Rational values and high Self
   Expression values on the Inglehart-Weltzel values map) and stable
   democratization.^[4] However, the recurrent post-elections clashes in
   largely protestant Sub-Saharan countries, such as Kenya or Uganda,
   shows that religious affiliations seem to poorly affect the political
   behaviour of populations.

National political cultures

   [edit]

Russia

   [edit]

   Russia is a low-trust society, with even the highest trusted
   institutions of church and the military having more distrustful than
   trusting citizens, and with low participation in civil society.^[3]^[5]
   This means that Russia has a weak civic political culture. Furthermore,
   the authoritarian traditions of Russia mean that there is little
   support for democratic norms such as tolerance of dissent and
   pluralism.^[6] Russia has a history of authoritarian rulers from Ivan
   the Terrible to Joseph Stalin, who have engaged in massive repression
   of all potential political competitors, from the oprichnina to the
   Great Purge. The resulting political systems of Tsarist autocracy and
   Soviet communism had no space for independent institutions.^[citation
   needed]

United States

   [edit]
   Main article: Political culture of the United States
   Further information: Albion's Seed

   The political culture of the United States was heavily influenced by
   the background of its early immigrants, as it is a settler society.
   Samuel P. Huntington identified American politics as having a "Tudor"
   character, with elements of English political culture of that period,
   such as common law, strong courts, local self-rule, decentralized
   sovereignty across institutions, and reliance on popular militias
   instead of a standing army, having been imported by early settlers.^[7]
   Another source of political culture was the arrival of Scotch-Irish
   Americans, who came from a violent region of Britain, and brought with
   them a strong sense of individualism and support for the right to bear
   arms.^[8] These settlers provided the support for Jacksonian democracy,
   which was a revolution of its time against the established elites, and
   remnants of which can still be seen in modern American populism.^[8]

China

   [edit]

   The political culture of China is tied closely to political
   socialization, as children are indoctrinated into the collectivist
   perspective of the Chinese Communist Party. This inculcation is
   theorized to explain the delayed growth of secularism in Chinese
   culture, especially during the Cultural Revolution.^[9] Chinese
   political culture perceives the relationship between government and
   individuals to be a hierarchy. Because of this, there is little
   pushback from individuals during policy and regulation change. The
   political culture also shows a trend against confrontationality, which
   decreases the quantity and frequency of social conflict.^[10] Both of
   these qualities stem from traditional Chinese values embedded during
   the age of Confucianism. When the Chinese Communist Party took power in
   1948, Mao Zedong unsuccessfully attempted to remove these traits from
   the culture, instead opting for revolutionary values and
   priorities.^[11]

India

   [edit]

   Due to India's colonization by the British Empire, the contemporary
   political culture has been influenced by western ideas that were not
   present before, so we also follow western political culture. These
   influences include democracy and parliamentary systems, two
   institutions that stood ideologically opposite of the caste system that
   dictated society before.^[12] Because of India's multicultural
   demography, the political culture varies by group and region. India's
   successful democratization lead to power being given to both the
   urbanized and well-educated class who focused on national appeal, as
   well as more traditional, rural, and lower class political actors.^[13]
   In the modern era, the class system of India has begun to break down,
   and members of lower classes are now entering higher political and
   economic positions. This is especially true for lower class women, who
   historically have been excluded from such activities.^[14]
