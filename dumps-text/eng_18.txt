   A blood culture is a medical laboratory test used to detect bacteria or
   fungi in a person's blood. Under normal conditions, the blood does not
   contain microorganisms: their presence can indicate a bloodstream
   infection such as bacteremia or fungemia, which in severe cases may
   result in sepsis. By culturing the blood, microbes can be identified
   and tested for resistance to antimicrobial drugs, which allows
   clinicians to provide an effective treatment.

   To perform the test, blood is drawn into bottles containing a liquid
   formula that enhances microbial growth, called a culture medium.
   Usually, two containers are collected during one draw, one of which is
   designed for aerobic organisms that require oxygen, and one of which is
   for anaerobic organisms, that do not. These two containers are referred
   to as a set of blood cultures. Two sets of blood cultures are sometimes
   collected from two different blood draw sites. If an organism only
   appears in one of the two sets, it is more likely to represent
   contamination with skin flora than a true bloodstream infection. False
   negative results can occur if the sample is collected after the person
   has received antimicrobial drugs or if the bottles are not filled with
   the recommended amount of blood. Some organisms do not grow well in
   blood cultures and require special techniques for detection.

   The containers are placed in an incubator for several days to allow the
   organisms to multiply. If microbial growth is detected, a Gram stain is
   conducted from the culture bottle to confirm that organisms are present
   and provide preliminary information about their identity. The blood is
   then subcultured, meaning it is streaked onto an agar plate to isolate
   microbial colonies for full identification and antimicrobial
   susceptibility testing. Because it is essential that bloodstream
   infections are diagnosed and treated quickly, rapid testing methods
   have been developed using technologies like polymerase chain reaction
   and MALDI-TOF MS.

   Procedures for culturing the blood were published as early as the
   mid-19th century, but these techniques were labour-intensive and bore
   little resemblance to contemporary methods. Detection of microbial
   growth involved visual examination of the culture bottles until
   automated blood culture systems, which monitor gases produced by
   microbial metabolism, were introduced in the 1970s. In developed
   countries, manual blood culture methods have largely been made obsolete
   by automated systems.

Medical uses

   [edit]

   Blood is normally sterile.^[1] The presence of bacteria in the blood is
   termed bacteremia, and the presence of fungi is called fungemia.^[2]
   Minor damage to the skin^[3] or mucous membranes, which can occur in
   situations like toothbrushing or defecation,^[4]^[5] can introduce
   bacteria into the bloodstream, but this bacteremia is normally
   transient and is rarely detected in cultures because the immune system
   and reticuloendothelial system quickly sequester and destroy the
   organisms.^[3]^[6] Bacteria can enter the blood from infections such as
   cellulitis, UTIs and pneumonia;^[7] and infections within the vascular
   system, such as bacterial endocarditis or infections associated with
   intravenous lines, may result in a constant bacteremia.^[4] Fungemia
   occurs most commonly in people with poorly functioning immune
   systems.^[2] If bacteria or fungi are not cleared from the bloodstream,
   they can spread to other organs and tissues,^[3] or evoke an immune
   response that leads to a systemic inflammatory condition called sepsis,
   which can be life-threatening.^[8]^[9]

   When sepsis is suspected, it is necessary to draw blood cultures to
   identify the causative agent and provide targeted antimicrobial
   therapy.^[10] People who are hospitalized and have a fever, a low body
   temperature, a high white blood cell count or a low count of
   granulocytes (a category of white blood cells) commonly have cultures
   drawn to detect a possible bloodstream infection.^[11]^[12] Blood
   cultures are used to detect bloodstream infections in febrile
   neutropenia, a common complication of chemotherapy in which fever
   occurs alongside a severely low count of neutrophils (white blood cells
   that defend against bacterial and fungal pathogens).^[13]^[14]^[15]
   Bacteremia is common in some types of infections, such as meningitis,
   septic arthritis and epidural abscesses, so blood cultures are
   indicated in these conditions. In infections less strongly associated
   with bacteremia, blood culture may still be indicated if the individual
   is at high risk of acquiring an intravascular infection or if cultures
   cannot be promptly obtained from the main site of infection (for
   example, a urine culture in pyelonephritis or a sputum culture in
   severe community-acquired pneumonia).^[16]^[17] Blood culture can
   identify an underlying microbial cause in cases of endocarditis^[18]
   and fever of unknown origin.^[11]^[19]

   The pathogens most frequently identified in blood cultures include
   Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and other members of the family
   Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
   Candida albicans.^[20]^[21] Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are
   also commonly encountered, although it is often unclear whether these
   organisms, which constitute part of the normal skin flora,^[22] are
   true pathogens or merely contaminants.^[21] In blood cultures taken
   from newborn babies and children, CNS can indicate significant
   infections.^[23] The epidemiology of bloodstream infections varies with
   time and place; for instance, Gram-positive organisms overtook
   Gram-negative organisms as the predominant cause of bacteremia in the
   United States during the 1980s and 1990s,^[24] and rates of fungemia
   have greatly increased in association with a growing population of
   people receiving immunosuppressive treatments such as
   chemotherapy.^[25] Gram-negative sepsis is more common in Central and
   South America, Eastern Europe, and Asia than in North America and
   Western Europe; and in Africa, Salmonella enterica is a leading cause
   of bacteremia.^[26]

Procedure

   [edit]
   Three clear bottles with differently coloured caps and labels.
   Anaerobic, aerobic, and paediatric blood culture bottles

Collection

   [edit]

   Blood cultures are typically drawn through venipuncture. Collecting the
   sample from an intravenous line is not recommended, as this is
   associated with higher contamination rates, although cultures may be
   collected from both venipuncture and an intravenous line to diagnose
   catheter-associated infections.^[11]^[27] Prior to the blood draw, the
   top of each collection bottle is disinfected using an alcohol swab to
   prevent contamination.^[11] The skin around the puncture site is then
   cleaned and left to dry; some protocols recommend disinfection with an
   alcohol-based antiseptic followed by either chlorhexidine or an
   iodine-based preparation,^[note 1]^[27]^[28] while others consider
   using only an alcohol-containing antiseptic to be sufficient.^[17]^[29]
   If blood must be drawn for other tests at the same time as a blood
   culture, the culture bottles are drawn first to minimize the risk of
   contamination.^[30] Because antimicrobial therapy can cause false
   negative results by inhibiting the growth of microbes, it is
   recommended that blood cultures are drawn before antimicrobial drugs
   are given, although this may be impractical in people who are
   critically ill.^[10]

   A typical blood culture collection involves drawing blood into two
   bottles, which together form one "culture" or "set". One bottle is
   designed to enhance the growth of aerobic organisms, and the other is
   designed to grow anaerobic organisms. In children, infection with
   anaerobic bacteria is uncommon, so a single aerobic bottle may be
   collected to minimize the amount of blood required.^[31] It is
   recommended that at least two sets are collected from two separate
   venipuncture locations. This helps to distinguish infection from
   contamination, as contaminants are less likely to appear in more than
   one set than true pathogens. Additionally, the collection of larger
   volumes of blood increases the likelihood that microorganisms will be
   detected if present.^[32]

   Blood culture bottles contain a growth medium, which encourages
   microorganisms to multiply, and an anticoagulant that prevents blood
   from clotting.^[33] Sodium polyanethol sulfonate (SPS) is the most
   commonly used anticoagulant^[33] because it does not interfere with the
   growth of most organisms.^[28] The exact composition of the growth
   medium varies, but aerobic bottles use a broth that is enriched with
   nutrients, such as brain-heart infusion or trypticase soy broth,^[34]
   and anaerobic bottles typically contain a reducing agent such as
   thioglycollate. The empty space in an anaerobic bottle is filled with a
   gas mixture that does not contain oxygen.^[33]^[35]

   Many commercially manufactured bottles contain a resin that absorbs
   antibiotics to reduce their action on the microorganisms in the
   sample.^[11] Bottles intended for paediatric use are designed to
   accommodate lower blood volumes and have additives that enhance the
   growth of pathogens more commonly found in children.^[36] Other
   specialized bottles may be used to detect fungi and mycobacteria.^[35]
   In low and middle income countries, pre-formulated culture bottles can
   be prohibitively expensive, and it may be necessary to prepare the
   bottles manually. It can be difficult to access the proper supplies and
   facilities,^[37] and in some regions, it may not be possible to perform
   blood cultures at all.^[38]

   It is important that the bottles are neither underfilled nor
   overfilled: underfilling can lead to false negative results as fewer
   organisms are present in the sample, while overfilling can inhibit
   microbial growth because the ratio of growth medium to blood is
   comparatively lower. A 1:10 to 1:5 ratio of blood to culture medium is
   suggested to optimize microbial growth.^[28]^[39] For routine blood
   cultures in adults, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
   (CLSI) recommends the collection of two sets of bottles from two
   different draws, with 20–30 mL of blood drawn in each set.^[11] In
   children, the amount of blood to be drawn is often based on the child's
   age or weight.^[36]^[40] If endocarditis is suspected, a total of six
   bottles may be collected.^[41]

Culturing

   [edit]
   See caption. Signs of growth in manual blood culture systems: a) a film
   of growth (pellicle) on the surface; b) bubbles from gas production; c)
   turbidity from microbial growth (in right bottle); d) visible microbial
   colonies^[42]

   After the blood is collected, the bottles are incubated at body
   temperature to encourage the growth of microorganisms. Bottles are
   usually incubated for up to five days in automated systems,^[43]
   although most common bloodstream pathogens are detected within 48
   hours.^[44] The incubation time may be extended further if manual blood
   culture methods are used or if slower-growing organisms, such as
   certain bacteria that cause endocarditis, are suspected.^[43]^[45] In
   manual systems, the bottles are visually examined for indicators of
   microbial growth, which might include cloudiness, the production of
   gas, the presence of visible microbial colonies, or a change in colour
   from the digestion of blood, which is called hemolysis. Some manual
   blood culture systems indicate growth using a compartment that fills
   with fluid when gases are produced, or a miniature agar plate which is
   periodically inoculated by tipping the bottle.^[46] To ensure that
   positive blood cultures are not missed, a sample from the bottle is
   often inoculated onto an agar plate (subcultured) at the end of the
   incubation period regardless of whether or not indicators of growth are
   observed.^[47]

   In developed countries, manual culture methods have largely been
   replaced by automated systems that provide continuous computerized
   monitoring of the culture bottles.^[48] These systems, such as the
   BACTEC, BacT/ALERT and VersaTrek, consist of an incubator in which the
   culture bottles are continuously mixed. Growth is detected by sensors
   that measure the levels of gases inside the bottle—most commonly carbon
   dioxide—which serve as an indicator of microbial metabolism.^[46] An
   alarm or a visual indicator alerts the microbiologist to the presence
   of a positive blood culture bottle.^[49] If the bottle remains negative
   at the end of the incubation period, it is generally discarded without
   being subcultured.^[47]

   A technique called the lysis-centrifugation method can be used for
   improved isolation of slow-growing or fastidious organisms, such as
   fungi, mycobacteria, and Legionella.^[50]^[51] Rather than incubating
   the blood in a bottle filled with growth medium,^[52] this method
   involves collecting blood into a tube containing an agent that destroys
   (lyses) red and white blood cells, then spinning the sample in a
   centrifuge. This process concentrates the solid contents of the sample,
   including microorganisms if present, into a pellet, which is used to
   inoculate the subculture media. While lysis-centrifugation offers
   greater sensitivity than conventional blood culture methods, it is
   prone to contamination because it requires extensive manipulation of
   the sample.^[53]

Identification

   Growth of Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram-positive coccus and a pathogen
   commonly isolated from blood cultures, on blood agar.

   If growth is detected, a microbiologist will perform a Gram stain on a
   sample of blood from the bottle for a rapid preliminary identification
   of the organism.^[54] The Gram stain classifies bacteria as
   Gram-positive or Gram-negative and provides information about their
   shape—whether they are rod-shaped (referred to as bacilli), spherical
   (referred to as cocci), or spiral-shaped (spirochetes)—as well as their
   arrangement.^[55] Gram-positive cocci in clusters, for example, are
   typical of Staphylococcus species.^[56] Yeast and other fungi may also
   be identified from the Gram stain.^[57]^[58] A Gram stain identifying
   microbial growth from a blood culture is considered a critical result
   and must immediately be reported to the clinician.^[59] The Gram stain
   provides information about the possible identity of the organism, which
   assists the clinician in the selection of a more appropriate
   antimicrobial treatment before the full culture and sensitivity results
   are complete.^[54]

   In traditional methods, the blood is then subcultured onto agar plates
   to isolate the organism for further testing. The Gram stain results
   inform microbiologists about what types of agar plates should be used
   and what tests might be appropriate to identify the organism.^[60] In
   some cases, no organisms are seen on the Gram stain despite the culture
   bottle showing indicators of growth or being reported as positive by
   automated instruments. This may represent a false positive result, but
   it is possible that organisms are present but cannot easily be
   visualized microscopically. Positive bottles with negative Gram stains
   are subcultured before being returned to the incubator, often using
   special culture media that promotes the growth of slow-growing
   organisms.^[61]

   It typically takes 24 to 48 hours for sufficient growth to occur on the
   subculture plates for definitive identification to be possible.^[57] At
   this point, the microbiologist will assess the appearance of the
   bacterial or fungal colonies^[62] and carry out tests that provide
   information about the metabolic and biochemical features of the
   organism, which permit identification to the genus or species level.
   For example, the catalase test can distinguish streptococci and
   staphylococci (two genera of Gram-positive cocci)^[63] from each other,
   and the coagulase test can differentiate Staphylococcus aureus, a
   common culprit of bloodstream infections, from the less pathogenic
   coagulase-negative staphylococci.^[29]^[64]

   been placed, ready to load it into the sampling area of the MALDI-TOF
   instrument Loading a target plate containing microbial samples into a
   Bruker Biotyper, an instrument used for MALDI-TOF analysis in
   microbiology

   Microorganisms may also be identified using automated systems, such as
   instruments that perform panels of biochemical tests,^[65] or
   matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass
   spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), in which microbial proteins are ionized
   and characterized on the basis of their mass-to-charge ratios; each
   microbial species exhibits a characteristic pattern of proteins when
   analyzed through mass spectrometry.^[66]

   Because bloodstream infections can be life-threatening, timely
   diagnosis and treatment is critical,^[67] and to this end several rapid
   identification methods have been developed.^[57] MALDI-TOF can be used
   to identify organisms directly from positive blood culture bottles
   after separation and concentration procedures,^[68] or from preliminary
   growth on the agar plate within a few hours of subculturing.^[69]
   Genetic methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microarrays
   can identify microorganisms by detection of DNA sequences specific to
   certain species in blood culture samples. Several systems designed for
   the identification of common blood culture pathogens are commercially
   available.^[70] Some biochemical and immunologic tests can be performed
   directly on positive blood cultures, such as the tube coagulase test
   for identification of S. aureus^[57] or latex agglutination tests for
   Streptococcus pneumoniae,^[71] and unlike PCR and MALDI-TOF, these
   methods may be practical for laboratories in low and middle income
   countries.^[42] It is also possible to directly inoculate microbial
   identification panels with blood from a positive culture bottle,
   although this is not as reliable as testing subcultured bacteria
   because additives from the growth media can interfere with the
   results.^[72]

   Even faster diagnosis could be achieved through bypassing culture
   entirely and detecting pathogens directly from blood samples. A few
   direct testing systems are commercially available as of 2018, but the
   technology is still in its infancy. Most panels detect only a limited
   number of pathogens, and the sensitivity can be poor compared to
   conventional blood culture methods. Culturing remains necessary in
   order to carry out full antimicrobial sensitivity testing.^[73]

Antibiotic susceptibility testing

   [edit]

   Right: Pre-formulated panels loaded into a BD Phoenix M50, an
   instrument used for automated antibiotic sensitivity testing.

   Antimicrobial treatment of bloodstream infections is initially empiric,
   meaning it is based on the clinician's suspicion about the causative
   agent of the disease and local patterns of antimicrobial resistance.
   Carrying out antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) on pathogens
   isolated from a blood culture allows clinicians to provide a more
   targeted treatment and to discontinue broad-spectrum antibiotics, which
   can have undesirable side effects.^[8]^[10] In traditional AST methods,
   such as the disk diffusion test, pure colonies of the organism are
   selected from the subculture plate and used to inoculate a secondary
   medium. These methods require overnight incubation before results can
   be obtained.^[74] There are automated systems which use pre-formulated
   antibiotic panels, measure microbial growth automatically, and
   determine the sensitivity results using algorithms; some of these can
   provide results in as little as five hours, but others require
   overnight incubation as well.^[65]^[75]

   Rapid administration of effective antimicrobial drugs is crucial in the
   treatment of sepsis,^[8] so several methods have been developed to
   provide faster antibiotic sensitivity results. Conventional AST methods
   can be carried out on young growth from the subculture plate,^[76]
   pellets of microorganisms obtained from concentration and purification
   of the positive blood culture, or directly from the culture
   bottle.^[77]^[78] Because direct testing methods do not isolate the
   organisms, they do not provide accurate results if more than one
   microorganism is present, although this is an infrequent occurrence in
   blood cultures.^[76] Another source of error is the difficulty in
   standardizing the amount of bacteria in the sample (the inoculum),
   which has a profound effect on the test results.^[79]

   Genetic testing can be used for rapid detection of certain
   antimicrobial resistance markers.^[80] Methods such as PCR and
   microarrays, which can be performed directly on positive blood culture
   samples,^[70] detect DNA sequences associated with genes that confer
   resistance, such as the mecA gene found in methicillin-resistant
   Staphylococcus aureus or the vanA and vanB genes of
   vancomycin-resistant enterococci.^[68] MALDI-TOF has been explored as a
   rapid antimicrobial sensitivity testing method; principles involve
   measuring microbial growth in the presence of antibiotics, identifying
   the breakdown of antibiotics by microbial enzymes, and detecting
   protein spectra associated with bacterial strains that exhibit
   antibiotic resistance.^[79] Some of these methods can be performed on
   pellets from positive blood culture bottles.^[81] However, the lack of
   established methodologies for AST by MALDI-TOF limits its use in
   clinical practice,^[82] and direct AST by MALDI-TOF, unlike genetic
   testing methods, had not been approved by the Food and Drug
   Administration as of 2018.^[81]

Limitations

   [edit]

   Blood cultures are subject to both false positive and false negative
   errors. In automated culture systems, identification of positive
   bottles is based on the detection of gases produced by cellular
   metabolism, so samples with high numbers of white blood cells may be
   reported as positive when no bacteria are present. Inspection of the
   growth curve produced by the instrument can help to distinguish between
   true and false positive cultures, but Gram staining and subculturing
   are still necessary for any sample that is flagged as positive.^[61]

   Blood cultures can become contaminated with microorganisms from the
   skin or the environment, which multiply inside the culture bottle,
   giving the false impression that those organisms are present in the
   blood.^[11] Contamination of blood cultures can lead to unnecessary
   antibiotic treatment and longer hospital stays.^[29] The frequency of
   contamination can be reduced by following established protocols for
   blood culture collection, but it cannot be eliminated;^[83] for
   instance, bacteria can survive in deeper layers of the skin even after
   meticulous disinfection of the blood draw site.^[29] The CLSI defines
   an acceptable contamination rate as no greater than 3% of all blood
   cultures.^[11] The frequency of contamination varies widely between
   institutions and between different departments in the same
   hospital;^[83] studies have found rates ranging from 0.8 to 12.5
   percent.^[29]

   When faced with a positive blood culture result, clinicians must decide
   whether the finding represents contamination or genuine infection. Some
   organisms, such as S. aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae, are usually
   considered to be pathogenic when detected in a blood culture, while
   others are more likely to represent contamination with skin flora; but
   even common skin organisms such as coagulase-negative staphylococci can
   cause bloodstream infections under certain conditions. When such
   organisms are present, interpretation of the culture result involves
   taking into account the person's clinical condition and whether or not
   multiple cultures are positive for the same organism.^[29]

   False negatives may be caused by drawing blood cultures after the
   person has received antibiotics or collecting an insufficient amount of
   blood. The volume of blood drawn is considered the most important
   variable in ensuring that pathogens are detected: the more blood that
   is collected, the more pathogens are recovered.^[11] However, if the
   amount of blood collected far exceeds the recommended volume, bacterial
   growth may be inhibited by natural inhibitors present in the blood and
   an inadequate amount of growth medium in the bottle. Over-filling of
   blood culture bottles may also contribute to iatrogenic anemia.^[28]

   Not all pathogens are easily detected by conventional blood culture
   methods. Particularly fastidious organisms, such as Brucella and
   Mycobacterium species, may require prolonged incubation times or
   special culture media. Some organisms are exceedingly difficult to
   culture or do not grow in culture at all, so serology testing or
   molecular methods such as PCR are preferred if infection with these
   organisms is suspected.^[45]^[84]

History

   [edit]
   See caption. An early vacuum tube system for blood culture collection,
   described by C.E. Simon & C.C.W. Judd in 1915^[85]

   Early blood culture methods were labour-intensive.^[86] One of the
   first known procedures, published in 1869, recommended that leeches be
   used to collect blood from the patient.^[87] A microbiology textbook
   from 1911 noted that decontamination of the draw site and equipment
   could take over an hour, and that due to a lack of effective methods
   for preserving blood, the cultures would sometimes have to be prepared
   at the patient's bedside. In addition to subculturing the broth, some
   protocols specified that the blood be mixed with melted agar and the
   mixture poured into a petri dish.^[86] In 1915, a blood culture
   collection system consisting of glass vacuum tubes containing glucose
   broth and an anticoagulant was described. Robert James Valentine
   Pulvertaft published a seminal work on blood cultures in 1930,^[88]
   specifying—among other insights—an optimal blood-to-broth ratio of 1:5,
   which is still accepted today.^[87] The use of SPS as an anticoagulant
   and preservative was introduced in the 1930s and 40s and resolved some
   of the logistical issues with earlier methods.^[86] From the 1940s
   through the 1980s, a great deal of research was carried out on broth
   formulations and additives, with the goal of creating a growth medium
   that could accommodate all common bloodstream pathogens.^[87]

   In 1947, M.R. Castañeda invented a "biphasic" culture bottle for the
   identification of Brucella species, which contained both broth and an
   agar slant, allowing the agar to be easily subcultured from the
   broth;^[42] this was a precursor of some contemporary systems for
   manual blood cultures.^[43] E.G. Scott in 1951 published a protocol
   described as "the advent of the modern blood culture set".^[86] Scott's
   method involved inoculating blood into two rubber-sealed glass bottles;
   one for aerobes and one for anaerobes. The aerobic bottle contained
   trypticase soy broth and an agar slant, and the anaerobic bottle
   contained thioglycollate broth. The lysis-centrifugation method was
   introduced in 1917 by Mildred Clough, but it was rarely used in
   clinical practice until commercial systems were developed in the
   mid-1970s.^[86]^[89]

   Automated blood culture systems first became available in the
   1970s.^[90] The earliest of these—the BACTEC systems, produced by
   Johnston Laboratories (now Becton Dickinson)—used culture broths
   containing nutrients labelled with radioactive isotopes. Microbes that
   fed on these substrates would produce radioactive carbon dioxide, and
   growth could be detected by monitoring its concentration.^[50]^[91]
   Before this technique was applied to blood cultures, it had been
   proposed by NASA as a method for detecting life on Mars.^[86]
   Throughout the 1970s and 80s several manufacturers attempted to detect
   microbial growth by measuring changes in the electrical conductivity of
   the culture medium, but none of these methods were commercially
   successful.^[91]

   A major issue with the early BACTEC systems was that they produced
   radioactive waste, which required special disposal procedures,^[50] so
   in 1984 a new generation of BACTEC instruments was released that used
   spectrophotometry to detect CO[2].^[91] The BacT/ALERT system, which
   indirectly detects production of CO[2] by measuring the decrease in the
   medium's pH, was approved for use in the US in 1991. Unlike the BACTEC
   systems available at the time, the BacT/ALERT did not require a needle
   to be introduced into the bottle for sampling; this reduced the
   frequency of contamination^[91] and made it the first system to provide
   truly continuous monitoring of blood cultures.^[92] This non-invasive
   measurement method was adopted in 1992 by the BACTEC 9000 series, which
   used fluorescent indicators to detect pH changes.^[93] The Difco ESP, a
   direct predecessor of the contemporary VersaTREK system^[86] which
   detects gas production by measuring pressure changes, was also first
   approved in 1992.^[91] By 1996, an international study found that 55%
   of 466 laboratories surveyed were using the BACTEC or BacT/ALERT
   systems, with other automated systems accounting for 10% of the
   total.^[94]
