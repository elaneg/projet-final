   A cultural system is the interaction of different elements in culture.
   While a cultural system is very different from a social system,
   sometimes both systems together are referred to as the sociocultural
   system.

Social theory

   [edit]

   A major concern in the social sciences is the problem of order. One way
   that social order has been theorized is according to the degree of
   integration of cultural and social factors.

Action theory

   [edit]

   Talcott Parsons, a major figure in sociology and the main originator of
   action theory in the early 20th century, based his sociological theory
   of action system is built up around a general theory of society, which
   is codified within a cybernetic model featuring four functional
   imperatives: adaptation, goal-attainment, integration, and pattern
   maintenance. The hierarchy of systems is, from least to most
   encompassing system, respectively, behavioral organism, personality
   system, social system, and cultural system as well. Ritzer and Goodman
   (2004) summarize Parsons' view, "Parsons saw these action systems
   acting at different levels of analysis, starting with the behavioral
   organism and building to the cultural system. He saw these levels
   hierarchically, with each of the lower levels providing the impetus for
   the higher levels, with the higher levels controlling the lower
   levels." In an article, late in life, Parsons maintained that the term
   "functionalism" was an inappropriate characterization of his theory.

System and social integration

   [edit]

   The British Sociologist David Lockwood argued for a contrast between
   social content and social transmission in his work on social structure
   and agency. Noting that social systems were distinct in structure and
   transmission. Lockwood's conceptual distinction influenced Jürgen
   Habermas' discussion in the classic Legitimation Crises, who made the
   now famous distinction between system integration and social
   integration of the lifeworld.

Cultural and socio-cultural integration

   [edit]

   Margaret Archer (2004) in a revised edition of her classic work Culture
   and Agency, argues that the grand idea of a unified, integrated culture
   system, as advocated by early Anthropologists such as Bronisław
   Malinowski and later by Mary Douglas, is a myth. Archer reads this same
   myth through Pitirim Sorokin's influence and then Talcott Parsons'
   approach to cultural systems (2004:3). The myth of a unified,
   integrated cultural system was also advanced by Western Marxists such
   as by Antonio Gramsci through the theory of cultural hegemony through a
   dominant culture. Basic to these mistaken conceptions was the idea of
   culture as a community of meanings, which function independently in
   motivating social behavior. This combined two independent factors,
   community and meanings which can be investigated quasi-independently
   (2004:4)

   Archer, a proponent of critical realism, suggests that cultural factors
   can be objectively studied for the degree of compatibility (and that
   various aspects of cultural systems may be found to contradict each
   other in meaning and use). And, social or community factors in
   socialization may be studied in the context of the transmission of
   cultural factors by studying the social uniformity (or lack thereof) in
   the transmitted culture. Cultural systems are used (and inform society)
   both through idea systems and the structuring of social systems. To
   quote Archer in this regard:

          "logical consistency is a property of the world of ideas; causal
          consistency is a property of people. The main proposition here
          is the two are logically and empirically distinct and, hence can
          vary independently of one another. Thus it is perfectly
          conceivable that any social unit, from a community to a
          civilization, could be found the principle ideational elements
          (knowledge, belief, norms, language, mythology, etc.) of which
          do display considerable logical consistency – that is, the
          components are consistent, not contradictory – yet the same
          social unit may be low on causal consensus. " (2004:4)

   Archer notes that the opposite may be the case: low cultural logical
   consistency and high social consistency. Complex societies can include
   complex sociocultural systems that mix of cultural and social factors
   with various levels of contradiction and consistency.

Research

   [edit]

   According to Burrowes (1996), in two recent approaches to the study of
   culture, in the 1980-1990s, the "cultural studies" and "cultural
   indicators" approaches, investigators explored the traditionally
   functionalist concern of "cultural systems integration." These two
   approaches could be synthesized in the investigating cultural systems.
   Burrowes (1996) writes, "If functionalism offers to this
   cross-fertilization a focus on the normative orders of society, the
   cultural indicators approach provides a rigorous methodology, and
   cultural studies caution a greater sensitivity to social hierarchies."
   Constrained by Merton's middle range theory [note: to be discussed
   here], the specification of cultural elements and social structures
   makes possible the investigation of specific cultural and social
   systems and their interaction.
