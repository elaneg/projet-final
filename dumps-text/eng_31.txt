   The Secretariat of Culture (Spanish: Secretaría de Cultura) — formerly
   known as the National Council for Culture and Arts (Spanish: Consejo
   Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes or CONACULTA) before being
   elevated to ministerial level in 2015^[1] — is a Mexican government
   agency in charge of the nation's museums and monuments, promoting and
   protecting the arts (visual, plastic, theatrical, musical, dance,
   architectural, literary, televisual and cinematographic), and managing
   the national archives.

   CONACULTA was created in 1988 as a decentralized body of the
   Secretariat of Public Education (Spanish: Secretaría de Educación
   Pública). On 18 December 2015, it was established as a separate
   secretariat following the passage of a law originally promoted three
   months earlier by President Enrique Peña Nieto.

   Diplomat, historian and lawyer Rafael Tovar y de Teresa was the first
   culture secretary; he served for one year after CONACULTA's elevation
   to a Cabinet-level position in December 2015 until 10 December 2016,
   when he died in Mexico City at the age of 62.^[2]^[3] The current
   culture secretary, since 2024, is Claudia Curiel de Icaza.^[4]

   Subsidiaries of the Secretariat of Culture include the Vasconcelos
   Library, the National Fund for Culture and the Arts (FONCA), the
   Mexican Film Institute (IMCINE), the National Institute of Anthropology
   and History (INAH) and the National Institute of Fine Arts and
   Literature (INBA).

Broadcasting

   [edit]

   Upon its creation, the Secretariat of Culture took control of
   CONACULTA's television station Canal 22, seen on air in Mexico City and
   relayed by 25 SPR transmitters, as well as Radio Educación, which had
   previously been part of the SEP. Both stations transmit cultural and
   educational content.
