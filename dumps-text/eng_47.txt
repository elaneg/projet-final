The rise of cultivated meat II: beyond cell culture

   Elena Corujo Simon

   9 October 2024

   In our previous blog (Future of Food: Exploring the Rise of Cultivated
   Meat), guest bloggers, Wynsee Lu and Mekumi Chan, told us about the
   potential of cultivated meat as a sustainable food option. As they read
   articles on the topic, they discovered this industry goes beyond
   standard cell culture. In fact, there are a lot of additional aspects
   to consider for cultivated meat. Lab-grown meat is a great example of
   how we need to have molecular understanding to effectively engineer new
   products. In this blog, they explore the diversity in this industry and
   its potential for growth.

The molecular origin of flavour

   For consumers, the most important sensory characteristics of cultivated
   meats are the taste and texture compared to real meat. The main way
   industries have attempted to achieve the natural taste of meat within
   this sustainable food option is by mimicking the Maillard reaction. The
   Maillard reaction is the natural process that normal meats undergo when
   browning under heat to bring out aromas and flavours. Simultaneous
   chemical reactions between the amino acids and reducing sugars in the
   meat achieve the desired outcome. To mimic this, researchers use a
   temperature-sensitive flavour-switchable scaffold to enhance the
   aromatic properties of cultivated meats. This scaffold “switches on’
   while cooking and the chemical reactions within it release crucial
   flavours to appease consumers. This is not the only way to reproduce
   the flavours of real meat and industries are developing new methods
   every day.

Scaffolds to build the right growth environment

   In the emerging world of technology, computational modeling is at the
   forefront of science. The use of 3D models has even extended to the
   industry of cultivated meats to select certain materials, shapes, or
   topography of scaffolds, allowing uniformity across a particular meat
   type. In addition, researchers are also investigating 3D
   microenvironments to grow and proliferate these stem cells instead of
   bioreactors. Cells are confined within 3D microenvironment, which can
   eradicate the shear stress presented by microcarriers and prevent the
   aggregate accumulation occurring in bioreactors. Through the science of
   scaffolding, scientists can ‘build’ the desired shape of cultivated
   meats.

Companies leading the way in the sector

   Some companies are already beginning to utilize this research to pave
   the way for the future of cultivated meats. London based, Hoxton Farms,
   are a company dedicated to improving the flavour of lab grown meats. By
   cultivating the precursor cells (stem cells) of pork fat in a blend of
   plant- based nutrients, these cells can successfully grow and mature
   into pork fat, a popular ingredient in dishes known for its strong
   umami flavour. This technology is scaled using modular cultivators
   showing that flavour does not need to be compromised when choosing
   sustainable meats.

   Many vegans and vegetarians argue that while these sustainable meats do
   not involve the direct killing of animals, the growth of stem cells
   still require the use of animal products. Companies typically use
   foetal bovine serum (FBS) to cultivate the animal stem cells to grow
   their meats. However, FBS’s origin is the blood of a bovine foetus.

   Therefore, there has been recent research into non-animal-based growth
   media that could be applied to the cultured meat industry. Multus, a
   start-up company based at Imperial College London has developed an
   alternative to FBS. Multus distributes up to 10,000 L of its serum each
   week to cultivated meat companies around the world. This development
   allows companies to manufacture animal- free meats.

   Matrix Meats have also developed electro-spun nanofiber scaffolds that
   can be adapted to different meat development processes. Additionally,
   Aleph Farms are targeting the use of textured soy protein (TSP) as a
   material for this scaffold.

Potential for more improvements and companies in the sector

   The future of cultivated meat does not stop at cell culture. Further
   research into the practicalities of developing large-scale production
   of cultivated meats has to be considered as an important part of the
   future food production. Moreover, the rise in industries highlights the
   potential to play a huge role for economic growth and resilience!
