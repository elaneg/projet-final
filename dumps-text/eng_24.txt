   Term in public policy

   Culture change is a term used in public policy making and in workplaces
   that emphasizes the influence of cultural capital on individual and
   community behavior. It has been sometimes called repositioning of
   culture,^[1] which means the reconstruction of the cultural concept of
   a society.^[1] It places stress on the social and cultural capital
   determinants of decision making and the manner in which these interact
   with other factors like the availability of information or the
   financial incentives facing individuals to drive behavior.

   These cultural capital influences include the role of parenting,
   families and close associates; organizations such as schools and
   workplaces; communities and neighborhoods; and wider social influences
   such as the media. It is argued that this cultural capital manifests
   into specific values, attitudes or social norms which in turn guide the
   behavioral intentions that individuals adopt in regard to particular
   decisions or courses of action. These behavioral intentions interact
   with other factors driving behavior such as financial incentives,
   regulation and legislation, or levels of information, to drive actual
   behavior and ultimately feed back into underlying cultural capital.

   In general, cultural stereotypes present great resistance to change and
   to their own redefinition. Culture, often appears fixed to the observer
   at any one point in time because cultural mutations occur
   incrementally.^[2] Cultural change is a long-term process. Policymakers
   need to make a great effort to improve some basics aspects of a
   society's cultural traits.

Culture

   [edit]
   [250px-Beatles_ad_1965_just_the_beatles_crop.jpg] The Beatles are an
   example of changing cultural dynamics, including music, fashion, and
   lifestyle. Over a half century after their emergence, they continue to
   have a worldwide cultural impact.

   Raimon Panikkar identified 29 ways in which cultural change can be
   brought about, including growth, development, evolution, involution,
   renovation, reconception, reform, innovation, revivalism, revolution,
   mutation, progress, diffusion, osmosis, borrowing, eclecticism,
   syncretism, modernization, nudging ^[3] indigenization, and
   transformation.^[4] In this context, modernization could be viewed as
   adoption of Enlightenment era beliefs and practices, such as science,
   rationalism, industry, commerce, democracy, and the notion of progress.
   Rein Raud, building on the work of Umberto Eco, Pierre Bourdieu and
   Jeffrey C. Alexander, has proposed a model of cultural change based on
   claims and bids, which are judged by their cognitive adequacy and
   endorsed or not endorsed by the symbolic authority of the cultural
   community in question.^[5]

Cultural invention

   [edit]

   opposing the arrival of Captain James Cook in

   Assyrian child wearing traditional clothing

   Cultural invention has come to mean any innovation that is new and
   found to be useful to a group of people and expressed in their behavior
   but which does not exist as a physical object. Humanity is in a global
   "accelerating culture change period," driven by the expansion of
   international commerce, the mass media, and above all, the human
   population explosion, among other factors. Culture repositioning means
   the reconstruction of the cultural concept of a society.^[1]

   traditional clothing and jewelry

   Cultures are internally affected by both forces encouraging change and
   forces resisting change. These forces are related to both social
   structures and natural events, and are involved in the perpetuation of
   cultural ideas and practices within current structures, which
   themselves are subject to change.^[6] (See structuration.)

Social conflict

   [edit]

   Social conflict and the development of technologies can produce changes
   within a society by altering social dynamics and promoting new cultural
   models, and spurring or enabling generative action. These social shifts
   may accompany ideological shifts and other types of cultural change.
   For example, the U.S. feminist movement involved new practices that
   produced a shift in gender relations, altering both gender and economic
   structures. Environmental conditions may also enter as factors. For
   example, after tropical forests returned at the end of the last ice
   age, plants suitable for domestication were available, leading to the
   invention of agriculture, which in turn brought about many cultural
   innovations and shifts in social dynamics.^[7]

Diffusion

   [edit]

   Cultures are externally affected via contact between societies, which
   may also produce—or inhibit—social shifts and changes in cultural
   practices. War or competition over resources may impact technological
   development or social dynamics. Additionally, cultural ideas may
   transfer from one society to another, through diffusion or
   acculturation. In diffusion, the form of something (though not
   necessarily its meaning) moves from one culture to another. For
   example, Western restaurant chains and culinary brands sparked
   curiosity and fascination to the Chinese as China opened its economy to
   international trade in the late 20th-century.^[8] "Stimulus diffusion"
   (the sharing of ideas) refers to an element of one culture leading to
   an invention or propagation in another. "Direct borrowing," on the
   other hand, tends to refer to technological or tangible diffusion from
   one culture to another. Diffusion of innovations theory presents a
   research-based model of why and when individuals and cultures adopt new
   ideas, practices, and products.

Acculturation

   [edit]

   Acculturation has different meanings. Still, in this context, it refers
   to the replacement of traits of one culture with another, such as what
   happened to certain Native American tribes and many indigenous peoples
   across the globe during the process of colonization. Related processes
   on an individual level include assimilation (adoption of a different
   culture by an individual) and transculturation. The transnational flow
   of culture has played a major role in merging different cultures and
   sharing thoughts, ideas, and beliefs.

Achieving culture change

   [edit]

   The term is used by Knott et al. of the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit
   in their 2008 publication Achieving Culture Change: A Policy
   Framework.^[9] The paper sets out how public policy can achieve social
   and cultural change through 'downstream' interventions including fiscal
   incentives, legislation, regulation and information provision and also
   'upstream' interventions such as parenting, peer and mentoring
   programs, or development of social and community networks.

   The key concepts the paper is based on include:
     * Cultural capital - such as the attitudes, values, aspirations and
       sense of self-efficacy which influence behavior. Cultural capital
       is itself influenced by behavior over time
     * The shifting social zeitgeist - whereby social norms and values
       that predominate within the cultural capital in society evolve in
       over time
     * The process by which political narrative and new ideas and
       innovations shift the social zeitgeist over time within the
       constraint of the 'elastic band' of public opinion
     * The process of behavioral normalization - whereby behavior and
       actions pass through into social and cultural norms (for example,
       Knott et al. argue that the UK experience of seat belt enforcement
       established and reinforced this as a social norm)
     * The use of customer insight
     * The importance of tailoring policy programmes around an ecological
       model of human behavior to account for how policy will interact
       with cultural capital and affect it over time.

   Knott et al. use examples from a range of policy areas to demonstrate
   how the culture change framework can be applied to policymaking. for
   example:
     * To encourage educational aspiration they recommend more use of
       early years and parenting interventions, an improved childhood
       offer, and development of positive narratives on education as well
       as integrated advisory systems, financial assistance and targeted
       social marketing approaches.
     * To promote healthy living and personal responsibility they
       recommend building healthy living into community infrastructure,
       building partnerships with schools and employers, more one-to-one
       support for wellbeing alongside use of regulation and legislation
       on unhealthy products, provision of robust health information and
       health marketing to promote adaptive forms of behaviour.
     * To develop environmentally sustainable norms they recommend
       reinforcing sustainability throughout policy narratives, using
       schools and the voluntary sector to promote environmental messages,
       development of infrastructure that make sustainable choices easy,
       together with a wider package of measures on fiscal incentives,
       regulation, advisory services and coalition movements.
