   Internet culture is the set of practices, norms, aesthetics, and shared
   references that emerge in networked communication. The term covers the
   languages, rituals, humor, and genres that circulate across platforms,
   as well as communities, identities, and forms of collaboration that are
   native to online environments.^[1]^[2] Internet culture is shaped by
   the technical architecture of networks, the governance of platforms,
   and the political economy of data, which together condition how people
   find audiences, cooperate, and contest power online.^[3]^[4]^[5]

Terminology

   [edit]

   Writers have used related labels such as "cyberculture", "digital
   culture", and "network culture". Early work used "cyberculture" for the
   cultural imaginaries that formed around bulletin board systems, Usenet,
   and early web forums.^[6] Howard Rheingold popularized the term
   "netizen" to describe citizens of virtual communities who participate
   actively in online civic life.^[7] By the mid 2000s scholars emphasized
   participatory production and circulation, often using the language of
   "convergence culture" and "participatory culture".^[2]^[8] Some
   researchers prefer "networked publics" to capture how publics form
   through technical and social networks.^[9]^[3]

History

   [edit]
   Further information: History of the Internet
   [250px-Hexchat_2.16.0_screenshot.png] A screenshot of HexChat, an IRC
   client for GTK environments

   Many features of Internet culture have precedents in amateur radio,
   zines, fan clubs, and science fiction fandom, where enthusiasts built
   distributed publics and shared lore.^[6]^[2] These precursors
   established patterns of peer-to-peer communication, do-it-yourself
   publishing, and collaborative meaning-making that would later flourish
   online. Folklorists note that digital folklore adapts long standing
   forms, including jokes, legends, and collaborative storytelling, to the
   speed and scale of networked dissemination.^[10]
   [250px-CitadelBBSwindow.litlnemo.png] A screenshot of a bulletin board
   system

   From the 1970s through the 1990s, networked sociality formed on
   bulletin board systems, Usenet, Internet Relay Chat, and multi-user
   dungeons, where newcomers learned norms, jargon, and moderation
   practices.^[6] These spaces normalized pseudonymous identity, technical
   reputation, and volunteer governance that still influence contemporary
   platforms.^[11] As the network expanded beyond academic institutions,
   the term eternal September was coined to describe the phenomenon that
   began in September 1993, when America Online provided Usenet access to
   its users. This marked the beginning of a continuous influx of new
   users, newbies, unfamiliar with established online cultural norms and
   netiquette, effectively ending the cyclical nature of the previously
   observed September effect.

   The first decade of the web, roughly 1990-2000, featured personal
   homepages, webrings, and topic forums. Scholars document how
   communities organized conversation, built archives, and crafted rules
   for inclusion and exclusion.^[1]

   In the mid-2000s, the Web 2.0 wave introduced user-generated content
   and service-oriented platforms that lowered the costs of publishing and
   circulation.^[12] American media scholar Henry Jenkins described a
   participatory culture with "low barriers to artistic expression",
   sustained by informal mentorship and strong sharing norms.^[8]^[2]

   From the 2010s, social and search services centralized discovery
   through algorithmic ranking and recommendation systems. Scholars
   analyze this platformization of culture as a shift from open protocols
   to proprietary infrastructures that steer visibility and monetize
   attention.^[13]^[4]^[14]

   Early digital culture was predominantly centered in the Anglosphere.
   The Internet's origins as a British–American invention, combined with
   computer technology's reliance on textual coding systems primarily
   designed for the English language, gave Anglophone societies, and
   subsequently societies using Latin script-based languages, preferential
   access to digital culture. Over time, however, the linguistic landscape
   of the Internet has become more diverse. The proportion of
   English-language content on the Internet declined from approximately
   80% in the 1990s to 52.9% by 2018.^[15]^[16]

Characteristics

   [edit]

   Internet culture codifies practices for quoting, linking, crediting,
   and remixing that build on hypertext and URL technologies. Researchers
   describe "networked publics" with overlapping audiences and context
   collapse, where people juggle multiple roles across
   platforms.^[9]^[1]^[8]

Dominant subcultures

   [edit]

   Scholars describe several subcultures that structure online practice,
   including participatory fan networks, hacker and free software
   projects, influencer economies, and fringe communities that mobilize
   around niche interests.^[2]^[11]^[17]^[18]
     * Fan communities organize around serial storytelling, participatory
       archiving, and gift economies. American media scholar Henry Jenkins
       shows how fans extend narratives, coordinate creative labor in
       public, and negotiate authorship with media producers.^[2]^[19]

     * Hacker and free software communities stress peer review, version
       control, and moral claims about openness. Ethnography documents how
       "meritocracy" narratives coexist with gatekeeping practices and
       episodic protest.^[11]^[3]

     * Influencer cultures merge self branding, algorithmic engagement,
       and advertiser relationships. Researchers highlight precarious
       labor, audience labor, and aspirational entrepreneurship within
       these economies.^[17]^[20]^[21]

     * Niche communities form around specialized interests, while fringe
       networks use platform affordances for antagonistic and extremist
       mobilization. Researchers track radicalization pipeline dynamics,
       cross-platform migration, and the role of recommendation
       systems.^[18]^[4]

Memes and virality

   [edit]
   [250px-Doge_meme_example.jpg] An example of the Doge meme, popular in
   2013 and similar in style to earlier lolcats^[22]

   Memes function as units of cultural exchange that travel and change
   through imitation and derivation, enabled by digital reproduction and
   network effects. Israeli communication scholar Limor Shifman defines
   Internet memes as "groups of digital items" that are "circulated,
   imitated, and transformed" across platforms.^[23] Scholars analyze
   formats such as image macros, reaction GIFs, short form video, and
   copypasta as genres with shared templates and norms.^[10]^[19]

Humor, irony, and play

   [edit]

   Playful transgression, irony, and in jokes are central to many
   communities, facilitated by pseudonymity and context collapse. American
   media scholar Whitney Phillips documents how subcultural humor can
   slide between "playful and poisonous" registers and can be amplified by
   news and platform dynamics.^[18]^[10]

   The online community can also have behaviors including conflict and
   aggression, such as trolling, the act of posting deliberately offensive
   or provocative content.

Remix, sampling, and intertextuality

   [edit]

   Remix practices borrow from existing media and from user generated
   artifacts, building on digital sampling and hyperlink technologies.
   Scholars frame this as vernacular creativity that draws on collective
   archives, with creators attributing sources, annotating with links, and
   iterating formats in public.^[19]^[1]

Identity and pseudonymity

   [edit]
   [250px-My_first_tweet%21_%283344952812%29.png] A Twitter post, with the
   user's profile picture

   Identity is negotiated through handles, avatars, and profiles, enabled
   by user account systems and profile technologies. Researchers have
   traced how pseudonymity fosters experimentation and risk taking while
   also enabling harassment and evasion. Work on race, gender, and class
   shows how offline inequalities are reproduced in search algorithms and
   visibility metrics.^[24]^[25]

   One early study, conducted from 1998 to 1999, found that the
   participants view information obtained online as slightly more credible
   than information from magazines, radio, and television, information
   obtained from newspapers was the most credible.^[26] Credibility online
   is established in much the same way that it is established in the
   offline world. Lawrence Lessig claimed that the architecture of a given
   online community may be the most important factor in establishing
   credibility. Factors include: anonymity, connection to physical
   identity, comment rating system, feedback type (positive vs
   positive/negative), moderation.^[27]
   See also: Anonymous post

   Many sites allow anonymous commentary, where the user-id attached to
   the comment may be labelled as a "guest" or any other sort of automatic
   name. In an architecture that allows anonymous commentary, credibility
   attaches only to the object of the comment. Sites that require some
   link to an identity may require only a nickname that is sufficient to
   allow comment readers to rate the commenter, either explicitly, or by
   informal reputation. However with the rise of oftentimes "careless"
   spreading of personal data with the integration of the internet into
   society, and the rise of concepts like the digital footprint,
   anonymity, while still possible, has decreased.^[28]

Language and communication

   [edit]

   Internet language blends technical slang with playful innovation,
   including abbreviations, leetspeak, and platform specific registers,
   shaped by character limits and keyboard constraints.^[29]^[30]

   Users supplement text with emoticons, emoji, stickers, and GIFs to
   manage tone and display affect, compensating for the limitations of
   plain text communication. These practices act as pragmatic cues in low
   context environments and support rapid phatic communication.^[29]^[30]

   Textual play persists through ASCII art, code block aesthetics, and
   copypasta that standardize rituals and inside jokes, building on
   character encoding and monospace font technologies.^[10]

   Image macros, screenshot essays, and stitched videos form recognizable
   vernaculars that travel across platforms and across languages, enabled
   by image compression, video codecs, and cross-platform sharing
   protocols.^[23]^[19]

Platforms

   [edit]

   Digital platforms serve as the primary infrastructure through which
   internet culture is practiced, each embedding particular affordances,
   governance models, and social dynamics that shape how communities form,
   communicate, and create meaning online. These platforms are not neutral
   containers but actively mediate cultural expression through their
   architecture, purpose, and design choices around identity, visibility,
   temporality, and interaction.
   [250px-StackOverflow.com_Top_Questions_Page_Screenshot.png] A "Top
   questions" page on Stack Overflow
     * Forums and message boards feature thread based conversation,
       volunteer moderators, and repost norms. Scholars link these
       governance repertoires to earlier Internet protocols and to
       hobbyist computing cultures. Examples include Reddit, 4chan, Stack
       Overflow, and Discourse.^[6]^[11]

     * Wikis and collaborative knowledge coordinate large scale
       collaboration through version control, talk pages, and rule making.
       Researchers analyze how openness coexists with gatekeeping and how
       policies routinize debate and consensus seeking. Wikipedia, Fandom,
       and GitHub wikis exemplify these practices.^[1]^[3]

   [250px-Wp-twentyten.jpg] A WordPress blog, using the default theme in
   2010
     * Blogs and microblogs organize reverse chronological updates and
       link based discovery. WordPress, Tumblr, Twitter, and Blogger
       enabled niche publics and new forms of commentary before feed
       algorithms reordered attention.^[3]^[31]

     * Social networking services tie profiles to social graphs and feed
       based interfaces on mobile devices. Scholars track how design
       decisions shape visibility, privacy defaults, and self
       presentation. Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and TikTok exemplify
       these designs.^[9]^[13]

     * Imageboards and ephemeral media enable rapid circulation and low
       friction posting. Researchers connect their vernaculars to
       anonymity, tactical visibility, and collective authorship. 4chan,
       8chan, Snapchat, and BeReal represent these approaches.^[18]^[10]

     * Video platforms and livestreaming concentrate creator economies,
       recommendation engines, and advertising markets. Studies examine
       how creators optimize for watch time, how moderation addresses harm
       at scale, and how recommendation systems structure discovery.
       YouTube, Twitch, TikTok, and Vimeo dominate these
       spaces.^[4]^[14]^[32]

     * Gaming platforms and virtual worlds host guilds, economies, and
       creative modding. Platform policies and player cultures shape voice
       chat, streaming, and esports spectatorship. Steam, Discord, World
       of Warcraft, and Roblox exemplify these environments.^[1]^[2]

     * Messaging apps and group chats support intimate publics and
       community care through private and semi private group messaging.
       Researchers note how end-to-end encryption and forwarding features
       also enable rapid rumor spread. WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, and
       Slack represent these platforms.^[1]^[33]

     * Decentralized and federated networks foreground open protocols and
       federation, which distribute control and complicate centralized
       governance. Scholarship links these designs to long standing
       debates about common carrier, interoperability, and public values
       online. Mastodon, Diaspora, Matrix, and ActivityPub based services
       exemplify these approaches.^[3]^[13]

     * Dark web and anonymity networks enable privacy focused
       communication through Tor, I2P, and other onion routing protocols.
       Research examines how technical anonymity shapes community norms,
       market structures on Silk Road, and information sharing practices
       distinct from surface web platforms.^[34]^[35]
