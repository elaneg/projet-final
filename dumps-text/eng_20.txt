   [250px-Egypt.Giza.Sphinx.02.jpg] Ancient Egypt is an example of one of
   the first civilizations, building pyramids starting in the 3rd
   millennium BCE.^[1]

   A civilization (also spelled civilisation in British English) is any
   complex society characterized by the development of the state, social
   stratification, urbanization, and symbolic systems of communication
   beyond signed or spoken languages (namely, writing
   systems).^[2]^[3]^[4]^[5]^[6]
   [250px-Standard_of_Ur_-_Peace_Panel_-_Sumer.jpg] The ancient Sumerians
   of Mesopotamia were the oldest civilization in the world, beginning
   about 4000 BCE, here depicted around 2500 BCE, showing the different
   social roles in the Sumerian society of Ur.

   Civilizations are organized around densely populated settlements,
   divided into more or less rigid hierarchical social classes of division
   of labour, often with a ruling elite and subordinate urban and rural
   populations, which engage in intensive agriculture, mining, small-scale
   manufacture and trade. Civilization concentrates power, extending human
   control over the rest of nature, including over other human beings.^[7]
   Civilizations are characterized by elaborate agriculture, architecture,
   infrastructure, technological advancement, currency, taxation,
   regulation, and specialization of labour.^[5]^[6]^[8]
   [250px-Shang_dynasty_inscribed_scapula.jpg] China is one of the oldest
   civilizations in the world, originating in the 21st century BCE and
   continuing to the present day.

   Historically, a civilization has often been understood as a larger and
   "more advanced" culture, in implied contrast to smaller, supposedly
   less advanced cultures,^[9]^[10]^[11]^[12] even societies within
   civilizations themselves and within their histories. Generally
   civilization contrasts with non-centralized tribal societies, including
   the cultures of nomadic pastoralists, Neolithic societies, or
   hunter-gatherers.

   The word civilization relates to the Latin civitas or 'city'. As the
   National Geographic Society has explained it: "This is why the most
   basic definition of the word civilization is 'a society made up of
   cities.'"^[13] The earliest emergence of civilizations is generally
   connected with the final stages of the Neolithic Revolution in West
   Asia, culminating in the relatively rapid process of urban revolution
   and state formation, a political development associated with the
   appearance of a governing elite.

History of the concept

   [edit]

   The English word civilization comes from the French civilisé
   ('civilized'), from Latin: civilis ('civil'), related to civis
   ('citizen') and civitas ('city').^[14] The fundamental treatise is
   Norbert Elias's The Civilizing Process (1939), which traces social
   mores from medieval courtly society to the early modern period.^[a] In
   The Philosophy of Civilization (1923), Albert Schweitzer outlines two
   opinions: one purely material and the other material and ethical. He
   said that the world crisis was from humanity losing the ethical idea of
   civilization, "the sum total of all progress made by man in every
   sphere of action and from every point of view in so far as the progress
   helps towards the spiritual perfecting of individuals as the progress
   of all progress".^[16]
   [250px-Gr%C3%BCn_-_The_End_of_Dinner.jpg] The End of Dinner by
   Jules-Alexandre Grün (1913). The emergence of table manners and other
   forms of etiquette and self-restraint are presented as a characteristic
   of civilized society by Norbert Elias in his book The Civilizing
   Process (1939).

   Related words like "civility" developed in the mid-16th century. The
   abstract noun "civilization", meaning "civilized condition", came in
   the 1760s, again from French. The first known use in French is in 1757,
   by Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau, and the first use in English
   is attributed to Adam Ferguson, who in his 1767 Essay on the History of
   Civil Society wrote, "Not only the individual advances from infancy to
   manhood but the species itself from rudeness to civilisation".^[17] The
   word was therefore opposed to barbarism or rudeness, in the active
   pursuit of progress characteristic of the Age of Enlightenment.

   In the late 1700s and early 1800s, during the French Revolution,
   "civilization" was used in the singular, never in the plural, and meant
   the progress of humanity as a whole. This is still the case in
   French.^[18] The use of "civilizations" as a countable noun was in
   occasional use in the 19th century,^[b] but has become much more common
   in the later 20th century, sometimes just meaning culture (itself in
   origin an uncountable noun, made countable in the context of
   ethnography).^[19] Only in this generalized sense does it become
   possible to speak of a "medieval civilization", which in Elias's sense
   would have been an oxymoron. Using the terms "civilization" and
   "culture" as equivalents is controversial and generally rejected, so
   that, for example, some types of culture are not normally described as
   civilizations.^[20]

   Already in the 18th century, civilization was not always seen as an
   improvement. One historically important distinction between culture and
   civilization is from the writings of Rousseau, particularly his work
   about education, Emile. Here, civilization, being more rational and
   socially driven, is not fully in accord with human nature, and "human
   wholeness is achievable only through the recovery of or approximation
   to an original discursive or pre-rational natural unity" (see noble
   savage). From this, a new approach was developed, especially in
   Germany, first by Johann Gottfried Herder and later by philosophers
   such as Kierkegaard and Nietzsche. This sees cultures as natural
   organisms, not defined by "conscious, rational, deliberative acts", but
   a kind of pre-rational "folk spirit". Civilization, in contrast, though
   more rational and more successful in material progress, is unnatural
   and leads to "vices of social life" such as guile, hypocrisy, envy and
   avarice.^[18] In World War II, Leo Strauss, having fled Germany, argued
   in New York that this opinion of civilization was behind Nazism and
   German militarism and nihilism.^[21]

Characteristics

   [edit]
   [800px-AthensAcropolisDawnAdj06028.jpg] The Acropolis of Athens: Greece
   is traditionally seen as the cradle of a distinct European or "Western"
   civilization.^[22]^[23]

   Social scientists such as V. Gordon Childe have named a number of
   traits that distinguish a civilization from other kinds of
   society.^[24]^[25] Civilizations have been distinguished by their means
   of subsistence, types of livelihood, settlement patterns, forms of
   government, social stratification, economic systems, literacy and other
   cultural traits. Andrew Nikiforuk argues that "civilizations relied on
   shackled human muscle. It took the energy of slaves to plant crops,
   clothe emperors, and build cities" and considers slavery to be a common
   feature of pre-modern civilizations.^[26]

   All civilizations have depended on agriculture for subsistence, with
   the possible exception of some early civilizations in Peru which may
   have depended upon maritime resources.^[27]^[28] Most developed and
   permanent civilizations depended on cereal agriculture. The traditional
   "surplus model" postulates that cereal farming results in accumulated
   storage and a surplus of food, particularly when people use intensive
   agricultural techniques such as artificial fertilization, irrigation
   and crop rotation. It is possible but more difficult to accumulate
   horticultural production, and so civilizations based on horticultural
   gardening have been very rare.^[29] Grain surpluses have been
   especially important because grain can be stored for a long time.

   Research from the Journal of Political Economy contradicts the surplus
   model. It postulates that horticultural gardening was more productive
   than cereal farming. However, only cereal farming produced civilization
   because of the appropriability of the yearly harvest. Rural populations
   that could only grow cereals could be taxed allowing for a taxing elite
   and urban development. This also had a negative effect on the rural
   population, increasing relative agricultural output per farmer. Farming
   efficiency created food surplus and sustained the food surplus through
   decreasing rural population growth in favour of urban growth.
   Suitability of highly productive roots and tubers was in fact a curse
   of plenty, which prevented the emergence of states and impeded economic
   development.^[30]^[31]

   A surplus of food permits some people to do things besides producing
   food for a living: early civilizations included soldiers, artisans,
   priests and priestesses, and other people with specialized careers. A
   surplus of food results in a division of labour and a more diverse
   range of human activity, a defining trait of civilizations. However, in
   some places hunter-gatherers have had access to food surpluses, such as
   among some of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest and
   perhaps during the Mesolithic Natufian culture. It is possible that
   food surpluses and relatively large scale social organization and
   division of labour predates plant and animal domestication.^[32]

   Civilizations have distinctly different settlement patterns from other
   societies. The word civilization is sometimes defined as "living in
   cities".^[33] Non-farmers tend to gather in cities to work and to
   trade.

   Compared with other societies, civilizations have a more complex
   political structure, namely the state.^[34] State societies are more
   stratified^[35] than other societies; there is a greater difference
   among the social classes. The ruling class, normally concentrated in
   the cities, has control over much of the surplus and exercises its will
   through the actions of a government or bureaucracy. Morton Fried, a
   conflict theorist and Elman Service, an integration theorist, have
   classified human cultures based on political systems and social
   inequality. This system of classification contains four
   categories.^[36]
     * Hunter-gatherer bands, which are generally egalitarian.^[37]
     * Horticultural–pastoralist societies in which there are generally
       two inherited social classes: chief and commoner.
     * Highly stratified structures, or chiefdoms, with several inherited
       social classes: king, noble, freemen, serf and slave.
     * Civilizations, with complex social hierarchies and organized,
       institutional forms of government.^[38]

   Economically, civilizations display more complex patterns of ownership
   and exchange than less organized societies. Living in one place allows
   people to accumulate more personal possessions than nomadic people.
   Some people also acquire landed property, or private ownership of the
   land. Because a percentage of people in civilizations do not grow their
   own food, they must trade their goods and services for food in a market
   system, or receive food through the levy of tribute, redistributive
   taxation, tariffs or tithes from the food producing segment of the
   population. Early human cultures functioned through a gift economy
   supplemented by limited barter systems. By the early Iron Age,
   contemporary civilizations developed money as a medium of exchange for
   increasingly complex transactions. In a village, the potter makes a pot
   for the brewer and the brewer compensates the potter by giving him a
   certain amount of beer. In a city, the potter may need a new roof, the
   roofer may need new shoes, the cobbler may need new horseshoes, the
   blacksmith may need a new coat and the tanner may need a new pot. These
   people may not be personally acquainted with one another and their
   needs may not occur all at the same time. A monetary system is a way of
   organizing these obligations to ensure that they are fulfilled. From
   the days of the earliest monetarized civilizations, monopolistic
   controls of monetary systems have benefited the social and political
   elites.

   The transition from simpler to more complex economies does not
   necessarily mean an improvement in the living standards of the
   populace. For example, although the Middle Ages is often portrayed as
   an era of decline from the Roman Empire, studies have shown that the
   average stature of males in the Middle Ages (c. 500 to 1500 CE) was
   greater than it was for males during the preceding Roman Empire and the
   succeeding Early Modern Period (c. 1500 to 1800 CE).^[39]^[40] Also,
   the Plains Indians of North America in the 19th century were taller
   than their "civilized" American and European counterparts. The average
   stature of a population is a good measurement of the adequacy of its
   access to necessities, especially food, and its freedom from
   disease.^[41]

   Writing, developed first by people in Sumer, is considered a hallmark
   of civilization and "appears to accompany the rise of complex
   administrative bureaucracies or the conquest state".^[42] Traders and
   bureaucrats relied on writing to keep accurate records. Like money, the
   writing was necessitated by the size of the population of a city and
   the complexity of its commerce among people who are not all personally
   acquainted with each other. However, writing is not always necessary
   for civilization, as shown by the Inca civilization of the Andes, which
   did not use writing at all but except for a complex recording system
   consisting of knotted strings of different lengths and colours: the
   "Quipus", and still functioned as a civilized society.

   Aided by their division of labour and central government planning,
   civilizations have developed many other diverse cultural traits. These
   include organized religion, development in the arts, and countless new
   advances in science and technology.

   Assessments of what level of civilization a polity has reached are
   based on comparisons of the relative importance of agricultural as
   opposed to trading or manufacturing capacities, the territorial
   extensions of its power, the complexity of its division of labour, and
   the carrying capacity of its urban centres. Secondary elements include
   a developed transportation system, writing, standardized measurement,
   currency, contractual and tort-based legal systems, art, architecture,
   mathematics, scientific understanding, metallurgy, political
   structures, and organized religion.

As a contrast with other societies

   [edit]

   The idea of civilization implies a progression or development from a
   previous "uncivilized" state. Traditionally, cultures that defined
   themselves as "civilized" often did so in contrast to other societies
   or human groupings viewed as less civilized, calling the latter
   barbarians, savages, and primitives. Indeed, the modern Western idea of
   civilization developed as a contrast to the indigenous cultures
   European settlers encountered during the European colonization of the
   Americas and Australia.^[43] The term "primitive," though once used in
   anthropology, has now been largely condemned by anthropologists because
   of its derogatory connotations and because it implies that the cultures
   it refers to are relics of a past time that do not change or
   progress.^[44]

   Because of this, societies regarding themselves as "civilized" have
   sometimes sought to dominate and assimilate "uncivilized" cultures into
   a "civilized" way of living.^[45] In the 19th century, the idea of
   European culture as "civilized" and superior to "uncivilized"
   non-European cultures was fully developed, and civilization became a
   core part of European identity.^[46] The idea of civilization can also
   be used as a justification for dominating another culture and
   dispossessing a people of their land. For example, in Australia,
   British settlers justified the displacement of Indigenous Australians
   by observing that the land appeared uncultivated and wild, which to
   them reflected that the inhabitants were not civilized enough to
   "improve" it.^[43] The behaviours and modes of subsistence that
   characterize civilization have been spread by colonization, invasion,
   religious conversion, the extension of bureaucratic control and trade,
   and by the introduction of new technologies to cultures that did not
   previously have them. Though aspects of culture associated with
   civilization can be freely adopted through contact between cultures,
   since early modern times Eurocentric ideals of "civilization" have been
   widely imposed upon cultures through coercion and dominance. These
   ideals complemented a philosophy that assumed there were innate
   differences between "civilized" and "uncivilized" peoples.^[46]

Cultural identity

   [edit]
   Further information: Cultural area and culture

   "Civilization" can also refer to the culture of a complex society, not
   just the society itself. Every society, civilization or not, has a
   specific set of ideas and customs, and a certain set of manufactures
   and arts that make it unique. Civilizations tend to develop intricate
   cultures, including a state-based decision-making apparatus, a
   literature, professional art, architecture, organized religion and
   complex customs of education, coercion and control associated with
   maintaining the elite.

   The intricate culture associated with civilization has a tendency to
   spread to and influence other cultures, sometimes assimilating them
   into the civilization, a classic example being Chinese civilization and
   its influence on nearby civilizations such as Korea, Japan and
   Vietnam^[47] Many civilizations are actually large cultural spheres
   containing many nations and regions. The civilization in which someone
   lives is that person's broadest cultural identity.^[48]^[49]
   [250px-Blue_Shield_Fact_Finding_Mission_Libyen.jpg] A Blue Shield
   International mission in Libya during the war in 2011 to protect the
   cultural assets there.

   It is precisely the protection of this cultural identity that is
   becoming increasingly important nationally and internationally.
   According to international law, the United Nations and UNESCO try to
   set up and enforce relevant rules. The aim is to preserve the cultural
   heritage of humanity and also the cultural identity, especially in the
   case of war and armed conflict. According to Karl von Habsburg,
   President of Blue Shield International, the destruction of cultural
   assets is also part of psychological warfare. The target of the attack
   is often the opponent's cultural identity, which is why symbolic
   cultural assets become a main target. It is also intended to destroy
   the particularly sensitive cultural memory (museums, archives,
   monuments, etc.), the grown cultural diversity, and the economic basis
   (such as tourism) of a state, region or
   community.^[50]^[51]^[52]^[53]^[54]^[55]

   Many historians have focused on these broad cultural spheres and have
   treated civilizations as discrete units. Early twentieth-century
   philosopher Oswald Spengler,^[56] uses the German word Kultur,
   "culture", for what many call a "civilization". Spengler believed a
   civilization's coherence is based on a single primary cultural symbol.
   Cultures experience cycles of birth, life, decline, and death, often
   supplanted by a potent new culture, formed around a compelling new
   cultural symbol. Spengler states civilization is the beginning of the
   decline of a culture as "the most external and artificial states of
   which a species of developed humanity is capable".^[56]

   This "unified culture" concept of civilization also influenced the
   theories of historian Arnold J. Toynbee in the mid-twentieth century.
   Toynbee explored civilization processes in his multi-volume A Study of
   History, which traced the rise and, in most cases, the decline of 21
   civilizations and five "arrested civilizations". Civilizations
   generally declined and fell, according to Toynbee, because of the
   failure of a "creative minority", through moral or religious decline,
   to meet some important challenge, rather than mere economic or
   environmental causes.

   Samuel P. Huntington defines civilization as "the highest cultural
   grouping of people and the broadest level of cultural identity people
   have short of that which distinguishes humans from other species".^[48]

Complex systems

   [edit]

   Persepolis.

   Another group of theorists, making use of systems theory, looks at a
   civilization as a complex system, i.e., a framework by which a group of
   objects can be analysed that work in concert to produce some result.
   Civilizations can be seen as networks of cities that emerge from
   pre-urban cultures and are defined by the economic, political,
   military, diplomatic, social and cultural interactions among them. Any
   organization is a complex social system and a civilization is a large
   organization. Systems theory helps guard against superficial and
   misleading analogies in the study and description of civilizations.

   Systems theorists look at many types of relations between cities,
   including economic relations, cultural exchanges and
   political/diplomatic/military relations. These spheres often occur on
   different scales. For example, trade networks were, until the
   nineteenth century, much larger than either cultural spheres or
   political spheres. Extensive trade routes, including the Silk Road
   through Central Asia and Indian Ocean sea routes linking the Roman
   Empire, Persian Empire, India and China, were well established 2000
   years ago when these civilizations scarcely shared any political,
   diplomatic, military, or cultural relations. The first evidence of such
   long-distance trade is in the ancient world. During the Uruk period,
   Guillermo Algaze has argued that trade relations connected Egypt,
   Mesopotamia, Iran and Afghanistan.^[57] Resin found later in the Royal
   Cemetery at Ur is suggested was traded northwards from Mozambique.

   Many theorists argue that the entire world has already become
   integrated into a single "world system", a process known as
   globalization. Different civilizations and societies all over the globe
   are economically, politically, and even culturally interdependent in
   many ways. There is debate over when this integration began, and what
   sort of integration – cultural, technological, economic, political, or
   military-diplomatic – is the key indicator in determining the extent of
   a civilization. David Wilkinson has proposed that economic and
   military-diplomatic integration of the Mesopotamian and Egyptian
   civilizations resulted in the creation of what he calls the "Central
   Civilization" around 1500 BCE.^[58] Central Civilization later expanded
   to include the entire Middle East and Europe, and then expanded to a
   global scale with European colonization, integrating the Americas,
   Australia, China and Japan by the nineteenth century. According to
   Wilkinson, civilizations can be culturally heterogeneous, like the
   Central Civilization, or homogeneous, like the Japanese civilization.
   What Huntington calls the "clash of civilizations" might be
   characterized by Wilkinson as a clash of cultural spheres within a
   single global civilization. Others point to the Crusading movement as
   the first step in globalization. The more conventional viewpoint is
   that networks of societies have expanded and shrunk since ancient
   times, and that the current globalized economy and culture is a product
   of recent European colonialism.^[citation needed]

History

   [edit]
   See also: Human history

   The notion of human history as a succession of "civilizations" is an
   entirely modern one. In the European Age of Discovery, emerging
   Modernity was put into stark contrast with the Neolithic and Mesolithic
   stage of the cultures of many of the peoples they
   encountered.^[59]^[obsolete source] Nonetheless, developments in the
   Neolithic stage, such as agriculture and sedentary settlement, were
   critical to the development of modern conceptions of
   civilization.^[60]^[61]

Urban Revolution

   [edit]
   Main articles: Neolithic, Bronze Age, Cradle of civilization, and River
   valley civilization

   The Natufian culture in the Levantine corridor provides the earliest
   case of a Neolithic Revolution, with the planting of cereal crops
   attested from c. 11,000 BCE.^[62]^[63] The earliest neolithic
   technology and lifestyle were established first in Western Asia (for
   example at Göbekli Tepe, from about 9,130 BCE), later in the Yellow
   River and Yangtze basins in China (for example the Peiligang and
   Pengtoushan cultures), and from these cores spread across Eurasia.
   Mesopotamia is the site of the earliest civilizations developing from
   7,400 years ago. This area has been evaluated by Beverley
   Milton-Edwards as having "inspired some of the most important
   developments in human history including the invention of the wheel, the
   building of the earliest cities and the development of written cursive
   script".^[64] Similar pre-civilized "neolithic revolutions" also began
   independently from 7,000 BCE in northwestern South America (the
   Caral-Supe civilization)^[65] and in Mesoamerica.^[66] The Black Sea
   area served as a cradle of European civilization. The site of
   Solnitsata – a prehistoric fortified (walled) stone settlement
   (prehistoric proto-city) (5500–4200 BCE) – is believed by some
   archaeologists to be the oldest known town in present-day
   Europe.^[67]^[68]^[69]^[70]

   The 8.2 Kiloyear Arid Event and the 5.9 Kiloyear Inter-pluvial saw the
   drying out of semiarid regions and a major spread of deserts.^[71] This
   climate change shifted the cost-benefit ratio of endemic violence
   between communities, which saw the abandonment of unwalled village
   communities and the appearance of walled cities, seen by some as a
   characteristic of early civilizations.^[72]
   [250px-Lascar_Avenue_of_the_Dead_and_the_Pyramid_of_the_Sun_in_the_back
   ground_%284566574277%29.jpg] The ruins of Mesoamerican city Teotihuacan

   This "urban revolution"—a term introduced by Childe in the 1930s—from
   the 4th millennium BCE,^[73] marked the beginning of the accumulation
   of transferable economic surpluses, which helped economies and cities
   develop. Urban revolutions were associated with the state monopoly of
   violence, the appearance of a warrior (or soldier) class and endemic
   warfare (a state of continual or frequent warfare), the rapid
   development of hierarchies, and the use of human sacrifice.^[74]^[75]

   The civilized urban revolution in turn was dependent upon the
   development of sedentism, the domestication of grains, plants and
   animals, the permanence of settlements and development of lifestyles
   that facilitated economies of scale and accumulation of surplus
   production by particular social sectors. The transition from complex
   cultures to civilizations, while still disputed, seems to be associated
   with the development of state structures, in which power was further
   monopolized by an elite ruling class^[76] who practiced human
   sacrifice.^[77]

   Towards the end of the Neolithic period, various elitist Chalcolithic
   civilizations began to rise in various "cradles" from around 3600 BCE
   beginning with Mesopotamia, expanding into large-scale kingdoms and
   empires in the course of the Bronze Age (Akkadian Empire, Indus Valley
   Civilization, Old Kingdom of Egypt, Neo-Sumerian Empire, Middle
   Assyrian Empire, Babylonian Empire, Hittite Empire, and to some degree
   the territorial expansions of the Elamites, Hurrians, Amorites and
   Ebla).

   Outside the Old World, development took place independently in the
   Pre-Columbian Americas. Urbanization in the Caral-Supe civilization in
   what is now coastal Peru began about 3500 BCE.^[78] In North America,
   the Olmec civilization emerged about 1200 BCE; the oldest known Mayan
   city, located in what is now Guatemala, dates to about 750 BCE.^[79]
   and Teotihuacan (near the modern Mexico City) was one of the largest
   cities in the world in 350 CE, with a population of about 125,000.^[80]

Axial Age

   Hinduism, Spread of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism

   The Bronze Age collapse was followed by the Iron Age around 1200 BCE,
   during which a number of new civilizations emerged, culminating in a
   period from the 8th to the 3rd century BCE which Karl Jaspers termed
   the Axial Age, presented as a critical transitional phase leading to
   classical civilization.^[81]

Modernity

   Divergence, and Age of Discovery

   Civilizations

   A major technological and cultural transition to modernity began
   approximately 1500 CE in Western Europe, and from this beginning new
   approaches to science and law spread rapidly around the world,
   incorporating earlier cultures into the technological and industrial
   society of the present.^[77]^[82]

Fall of civilizations

   [edit]

   Main article: Societal collapse

   Civilizations are traditionally understood as ending in one of two
   ways; either through incorporation into another expanding civilization
   (e.g. as Ancient Egypt was incorporated into Hellenistic Greek, and
   subsequently Roman civilizations), or by collapsing and reverting to a
   simpler form of living, as happens in so-called Dark Ages.^[83]

   There have been many explanations put forward for the collapse of
   civilization. Some focus on historical examples, and others on general
   theory.
     * Ibn Khaldun's Muqaddimah influenced theories of the analysis,
       growth, and decline of the Islamic civilization.^[84] He suggested
       repeated invasions from nomadic peoples limited development and led
       to social collapse. [960px-Invasions_of_the_Roman_Empire_1.png]
       Barbarian invasions played an important role in the fall of the
       Roman Empire.
     * Edward Gibbon's work The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is a
       well-known and detailed analysis of the fall of Roman civilization.
       Gibbon suggested the final act of the collapse of Rome was the fall
       of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 CE. For Gibbon, "The
       decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate
       greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the cause of
       the destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as
       soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the
       stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. The
       story of the ruin is simple and obvious; and instead of inquiring
       why the Roman Empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised
       that it has subsisted for so long".^[85]
     * Theodor Mommsen in his History of Rome suggested Rome collapsed
       with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE and he also
       tended towards a biological analogy of "genesis", "growth",
       "senescence", "collapse" and "decay".
     * Oswald Spengler, in his Decline of the West rejected Petrarch's
       chronological division, and suggested that there had been only
       eight "mature civilizations". Growing cultures, he argued, tend to
       develop into imperialistic civilizations, which expand and
       ultimately collapse, with democratic forms of government ushering
       in plutocracy and ultimately imperialism.
     * Arnold J. Toynbee in his A Study of History suggested that there
       had been a much larger number of civilizations, including a small
       number of arrested civilizations, and that all civilizations tended
       to go through the cycle identified by Mommsen. The cause of the
       fall of a civilization occurred when a cultural elite became a
       parasitic elite, leading to the rise of internal and external
       proletariats.
     * Joseph Tainter in The Collapse of Complex Societies suggested that
       there were diminishing returns to complexity, due to which, as
       states achieved a maximum permissible complexity, they would
       decline when further increases actually produced a negative return.
       Tainter suggested that Rome achieved this figure in the 2nd century
       CE.
     * Jared Diamond in his 2005 book Collapse: How Societies Choose to
       Fail or Succeed suggests five major reasons for the collapse of 41
       studied cultures: environmental damage, such as deforestation and
       soil erosion; climate change; dependence upon long-distance trade
       for needed resources; increasing levels of internal and external
       violence, such as war or invasion; and societal responses to
       internal and environmental problems.
     * Peter Turchin in his Historical Dynamics and Andrey Korotayev et
       al. in their Introduction to Social Macrodynamics, Secular Cycles,
       and Millennial Trends suggest a number of mathematical models
       describing collapse of agrarian civilizations. For example, the
       basic logic of Turchin's "fiscal-demographic" model can be outlined
       as follows: during the initial phase of a sociodemographic cycle we
       observe relatively high levels of per capita production and
       consumption, which leads not only to relatively high population
       growth rates, but also to relatively high rates of surplus
       production. As a result, during this phase the population can
       afford to pay taxes without great problems, the taxes are quite
       easily collectible, and the population growth is accompanied by the
       growth of state revenues. During the intermediate phase, the
       increasing population growth leads to the decrease of per capita
       production and consumption levels, it becomes more and more
       difficult to collect taxes, and state revenues stop growing,
       whereas the state expenditures grow due to the growth of the
       population controlled by the state. As a result, during this phase
       the state starts experiencing considerable fiscal problems. During
       the final pre-collapse phases the overpopulation leads to further
       decrease of per capita production, the surplus production further
       decreases, state revenues shrink, but the state needs more and more
       resources to control the growing (though with lower and lower
       rates) population. Eventually this leads to famines, epidemics,
       state breakdown, and demographic and civilization
       collapse.^[86]^[87]
     * Peter Heather argues in his book The Fall of the Roman Empire: a
       New History of Rome and the Barbarians^[88] that this civilization
       did not end for moral or economic reasons, but because centuries of
       contact with barbarians across the frontier generated its own
       nemesis by making them a more sophisticated and dangerous
       adversary. The fact that Rome needed to generate ever greater
       revenues to equip and re-equip armies that were for the first time
       repeatedly defeated in the field, led to the dismemberment of the
       Empire. Although this argument is specific to Rome, it can also be
       applied to the Asiatic Empire of the Egyptians, to the Han and Tang
       dynasties of China, to the Muslim Abbasid Caliphate and others.
     * Bryan Ward-Perkins, in his book The Fall of Rome and the End of
       Civilization,^[89] argues from mostly archaeological evidence that
       the collapse of Roman civilization in western Europe had
       deleterious impacts on the living standards of the population,
       unlike some historians who downplay this. The collapse of complex
       society meant that even basic plumbing for the elite disappeared
       from the continent for 1,000 years. Similar impacts have been
       postulated for the Dark Age after the Late Bronze Age collapse in
       the Eastern Mediterranean, the collapse of the Maya, on Easter
       Island and elsewhere.
     * Arthur Demarest argues in Ancient Maya: The Rise and Fall of a
       Rainforest Civilization,^[90] using a holistic perspective to the
       most recent evidence from archaeology, paleoecology, and epigraphy,
       that no one explanation is sufficient but that a series of erratic,
       complex events, including loss of soil fertility, drought and
       rising levels of internal and external violence led to the
       disintegration of the courts of Mayan kingdoms, which began a
       spiral of decline and decay. He argues that the collapse of the
       Maya has lessons for civilization today.
     * Jeffrey A. McNeely has recently suggested that "a review of
       historical evidence shows that past civilizations have tended to
       over-exploit their forests, and that such abuse of important
       resources has been a significant factor in the decline of the
       over-exploiting society".^[91]
     * Thomas Homer-Dixon considers the fall in the energy return on
       investments. The energy expended to energy yield ratio is central
       to limiting the survival of civilizations. The degree of social
       complexity is associated strongly, he suggests, with the amount of
       disposable energy environmental, economic and technological systems
       allow. When this amount decreases civilizations either have to
       access new energy sources or collapse.^[92]
     * Feliks Koneczny in his work "On the Plurality of Civilizations"
       calls his study the science on civilizations. He asserts that
       civilizations fall not because they must or there exist some
       cyclical or a "biological" life span and that there stil exist two
       ancient civilizations – Brahmin-Hindu and Chinese – which are not
       ready to fall any time soon. Koneczny claimed that civilizations
       cannot be mixed into hybrids, an inferior civilization when given
       equal rights within a highly developed civilization will overcome
       it. One of Koneczny's claims in his study on civilizations is that
       "a person cannot be civilized in two or more ways" without falling
       into what he calls an "abcivilized state" (as in abnormal). He also
       stated that when two or more civilizations exist next to one
       another and as long as they are vital, they will be in an
       existential combat imposing its own "method of organizing social
       life" upon the other.^[93] Absorbing alien "method of organizing
       social life" that is civilization and giving it equal rights yields
       a process of decay and decomposition.

Future

   [edit]

   [960px-Clash_of_Civilizations_mapn2.png] A world map of major
   civilizations according to the political hypothesis Clash of
   Civilizations by Samuel P. Huntington.

   According to political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, the 21st century
   will be characterized by a clash of civilizations,^[48] which he
   believes will replace the conflicts between nation-states and
   ideologies that were prominent in the 19th and 20th centuries. However,
   this viewpoint has been strongly challenged by others such as Edward
   Said, Muhammed Asadi and Amartya Sen.^[94] Ronald Inglehart and Pippa
   Norris have argued that the "true clash of civilizations" between the
   Muslim world and the West is caused by the Muslim rejection of the
   West's more liberal sexual values, rather than a difference in
   political ideology, although they note that this lack of tolerance is
   likely to lead to an eventual rejection of (true) democracy.^[95] In
   Identity and Violence Sen questions if people should be divided along
   the lines of a supposed "civilization", defined by religion and culture
   only. He argues that this ignores the many others identities that make
   up people and leads to a focus on differences.

   Cultural historian Morris Berman argues in Dark Ages America: the End
   of Empire that in the corporate consumerist United States, the very
   factors that once propelled it to greatness―extreme individualism,
   territorial and economic expansion, and the pursuit of material
   wealth―have pushed the United States across a critical threshold where
   collapse is inevitable. Politically associated with over-reach, and as
   a result of the environmental exhaustion and polarization of wealth
   between rich and poor, he concludes the current system is fast arriving
   at a situation where continuation of the existing system saddled with
   huge deficits and a hollowed-out economy is physically, socially,
   economically and politically impossible.^[96] Although developed in
   much more depth, Berman's thesis is similar in some ways to that of
   Urban Planner, Jane Jacobs who argues that the five pillars of United
   States culture are in serious decay: community and family; higher
   education; the effective practice of science; taxation and government;
   and the self-regulation of the learned professions. The corrosion of
   these pillars, Jacobs argues, is linked to societal ills such as
   environmental crisis, racism and the growing gulf between rich and
   poor.^[97]

   Cultural critic and author Derrick Jensen argues that modern
   civilization is directed towards the domination of the environment and
   humanity itself in an intrinsically harmful, unsustainable, and
   self-destructive fashion.^[98] Defending his definition both
   linguistically and historically, he defines civilization as "a
   culture... that both leads to and emerges from the growth of cities",
   with "cities" defined as "people living more or less permanently in one
   place in densities high enough to require the routine importation of
   food and other necessities of life".^[99] This need for civilizations
   to import ever more resources, he argues, stems from their
   over-exploitation and diminution of their own local resources.
   Therefore, civilizations inherently adopt imperialist and expansionist
   policies and, to maintain these, highly militarized, hierarchically
   structured, and coercion-based cultures and lifestyles.

   The Kardashev scale classifies civilizations based on their level of
   technological advancement, specifically measured by the amount of
   energy a civilization is able to harness. The scale is only
   hypothetical, but it puts energy consumption in a cosmic perspective.
   The Kardashev scale makes provisions for civilizations far more
   technologically advanced than any currently known to exist.

Non-human civilizations

   [edit]

   The current scientific consensus is that human beings are the only
   animal species with the cognitive ability to create civilizations that
   has emerged on Earth. A recent thought experiment, the silurian
   hypothesis, however, considers whether it would "be possible to detect
   an industrial civilization in the geological record" given the paucity
   of geological information about eras before the quaternary.^[100]

   Astronomers speculate about the existence of communicating intelligent
   civilizations within and beyond the Milky Way galaxy, usually using
   variants of the Drake equation.^[101] They conduct searches for such
   intelligences – such as for technological traces, called
   "technosignatures".^[102] The proposed proto-scientific field
   "xenoarchaeology" is concerned with the study of artifact remains of
   non-human civilizations to reconstruct and interpret past lives of
   alien societies if such get discovered and confirmed
   scientifically.^[103]^[104]

       spawning its own body of secondary literature. Notably, Hans Peter
       Duerr attacked it in a major work (3,500 pages in five volumes,
       published 1988–2002). Elias, at the time a nonagenarian, was still
       able to respond to the criticism the year before his death. In
       2002, Duerr was himself criticized by Michael Hinz's Der
       Zivilisationsprozeß: Mythos oder Realität (2002), saying that his
       criticism amounted to hateful defamation of Elias, through
       excessive standards of political correctness.^[15]

       Only Intelligent Life in the Galaxy", Scientific American, vol.
       319, no. 3 (September 2018), pp. 94–99. "Is life likely to exist
       elsewhere in the [Milky Way] galaxy? Almost certainly yes, given
       the speed with which it appeared on Earth. Is another technological
       civilization likely to exist today? Almost certainly no, given the
       chain of circumstances that led to our existence. These
       considerations suggest that we are unique not just on our planet
       but in the whole Milky Way. And if our planet is so special, it
       becomes all the more important to preserve this unique world for
       ourselves, our descendants and the many creatures that call Earth
       home." (p. 99.)
