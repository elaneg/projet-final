   The Museum of Pop Culture (or MOPOP) is a nonprofit museum in Seattle,
   Washington, United States, dedicated to contemporary popular culture.
   It was founded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in 2000 as the
   Experience Music Project. Since then MOPOP has organized dozens of
   exhibits, 17 of which have toured across the U.S. and internationally.

   The museum—formerly known as Experience Music Project, Experience Music
   Project and Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame (or EMP|SFM), and
   later EMP Museum until November 2016—has initiated many public programs
   including "Sound Off!", an annual 21-and-under battle-of-the-bands that
   supports the all-ages scene; and "Pop Conference", an annual gathering
   of academics, critics, musicians, and music buffs.

   MOPOP, in collaboration with the Seattle International Film Festival
   (SIFF), presents the Science Fiction and Fantasy Short Film Festival
   which takes place every winter. Since 2007, the MOPOP celebrates
   recording artists with the Founders Award for their noteworthy
   contributions.

Exhibits and activities

   [edit]

   MOPOP is home to numerous exhibits and interactive activity stations as
   well as sound sculpture and various educational resources:
     * A 140,000-square-foot (13,000 m^2) building, designed by Frank O.
       Gehry, housing several galleries and the Sky Church, which features
       a Barco C7 black package LED screen, one of the largest indoor LED
       screens in the world.^[1]
     * Exhibits covering pop culture, from the art of fantasy, horror
       cinema, and video games to science fiction literature and costumes
       from screen and stage.
     * Interactive activities are included in galleries like Sound Lab and
       On Stage where visitors can explore hands-on the tools of rock and
       roll through instruments, and perform music before a virtual
       audience.
     * IF VI WAS IX, a guitar sculpture consisting of more than 500
       musical instruments and 30 computers conceived by British exhibit
       designer Neal Potter and developed by sound sculptor
       Trimpin.^[2]^[3]
     * The world's largest collection of artifacts, hand-written lyrics,
       personal instruments, and original photographs celebrating the
       music and history of Seattle musician Jimi Hendrix and the band
       Nirvana.
     * Educational resources including MOPOP's Curriculum Connections
       in-museum workshops and outreach programs; STAR (Student Training
       in Artistic Reach); Creativity Camps for Kids; Teen Artist
       Workshops; Write Out of This World, an annual sci-fi and fantasy
       short story contest for 3rd to 12th graders; and the Hip-Hop Artist
       Residency.
     * Public programs such as MOPOP's Science Fiction + Fantasy Short
       Film Festival, Pop Conference, the Youth Advisory Board (YAB), and
       Sound Off!, the Pacific Northwest's premier battle-of-the-bands.

   MOPOP was also the location of the first NIME workshop's concert and
   demo program. This subsequently became the annual International
   Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression, a venue for
   research on music technology.

Science Fiction Museum

   [edit]

   The Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame was founded by Paul Allen
   and his sister Jody Patton, and opened to the public on June 18, 2004.
   It incorporated the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame which had
   been established in 1996. The museum was divided into several galleries
   with themes such as "Homeworld", "Fantastic Voyages", "Brave New
   Worlds", and "Them!", each displaying related memorabilia (movie props,
   first editions, costumes, and models) in large display cases, posters,
   and interactive displays. It was said about the museum that "From
   robots to jet packs to space suits and ray guns, it's all here."^[4]

   Members of the museum's advisory board included Steven Spielberg, Ray
   Bradbury, James Cameron, and George Lucas. Among its collection of
   artifacts were Captain Kirk's command chair from Star Trek, the B9
   robot from Lost in Space, the Death Star model from Star Wars, the
   T-800 Terminator and one of the domes from the film Silent Running.
   Although the Science Fiction Museum as a permanent collection was
   de-installed in March 2011, a new exhibit named Icons of Science
   Fiction opened as a replacement in June 2012.^[5]^[6] At this time the
   new Hall of Fame display was unveiled and the class of 2012
   inducted.^[7]^[8]

Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame

   [edit]

   The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame was founded in 1996 by the
   Kansas City Science Fiction and Fantasy Society and the Center for the
   Study of Science Fiction (CSSF) at the University of Kansas (KU). The
   chairmen were Keith Stokes (1996–2001) and Robin Wayne Bailey
   (2002–2004). Only writers and editors were eligible for recognition and
   four were inducted annually, two deceased and two living. Each class of
   four was announced at Kansas City's annual science fiction convention,
   ConQuesT, and inducted at the Campbell Conference hosted by
   CSSF.^[9]^[10]

   The Hall of Fame stopped inducting fantasy writers after 2004, when it
   became part of the Science Fiction Museum affiliated with the Museum of
   Pop Culture, under the name "Science Fiction Hall of Fame". Having
   inducted 36 writers in nine years, the organization began to recognize
   non-literary media in 2005.^[9] It retained the quota of four new
   members and thus reduced the annual number of writers. The 2005 and
   2006 press releases placed new members in "Literature", "Art", "Film,
   Television and Media", and "Open" categories, one for each
   category.^[11]^[12] In 2007 and 2008, the fourth inductee was placed in
   one of the three substantial categories.^[13]^[14]

   Nominations are submitted by the public, but the selections are made by
   "award-winning science fiction authors, artists, editors, publishers,
   and film professionals".^[15]

   MOPOP restored the original name online during June 2013 and announced
   five new members, one daily, beginning June 17, 2013. The first four
   were cited largely or wholly for science fiction works, however the
   final one was J.R.R. Tolkien, who was "hailed as the father of modern
   fantasy literature".^[16]

20th anniversary

   [edit]

   In 2016, the Hall of Fame's 20th anniversary year, the scope was
   changed again to include not only creators, but creations (from such
   genres as Cinema, Television and Games), with two examples. A total of
   20 additional inductees in both categories were also
   announced:^[31]^[22]
     * Creators: Margaret Atwood; Keith David; Guillermo del Toro; Terry
       Gilliam; Jim Henson; Jack Kirby; Madeleine L'Engle; C. S. Lewis; H.
       P. Lovecraft; Leonard Nimoy; George Orwell; Rumiko Takahashi; John
       Williams
     * Works: 2001: A Space Odyssey; Dungeons & Dragons; The Matrix; Myst;
       The Princess Bride; Wonder Woman; The X-Files

   The class of 2023 brought the number of members to 109, which includes
   the 20 additional inductees added in 2016.

   In November 2016, the museum changed its name from the Experience Music
   Project Museum to the Museum of Pop Culture, or MoPOP for short. In
   2025, the museum rebranded to MOPOP in all caps.^[32]

Architecture

   [edit]
   [250px-Skychurch2009.jpg]
   The Sky Church
   [250px-ExperienceMusicProject.jpg]
   An exterior view of the building

   MOPOP is located on the campus of Seattle Center, adjacent to the Space
   Needle and the Seattle Center Monorail, which runs through the
   building. The structure itself was designed by Frank Gehry and
   resembles many of his firm's other works in its sheet-metal
   construction, such as Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, Walt Disney Concert
   Hall, and Gehry Tower. Much of the building material is exposed in the
   building's interior. The building contains 140,000 square feet
   (13,000 m^2), with a 35,000-square-foot (3,300 m^2) footprint. The name
   of the museum's central Sky Church pays homage to Jimi Hendrix. A
   concert venue capable of holding up to 800 guests, the last structural
   steel beam to be put in place bears the signatures of all construction
   workers who were on site on the day it was erected. Hoffman
   Construction Company of Portland, Oregon, was the general contractor,
   while Magnusson Klemencic Associates of Seattle were the structural
   engineers for the project.^[33]
   [250px-Aerial_view_of_EMPSFM.jpg] Design by Frank Gehry

   Even before groundbreaking, the Seattle Weekly said the design could
   refer to "the often quoted comparison to a smashed electric guitar."
   Gehry himself had in fact made the comparison: "We started collecting
   pictures of Stratocasters, bringing in guitar bodies, drawing on those
   shapes in developing our ideas."^[34] The architecture was greeted by
   Seattle residents with a mixture of acclaim for Gehry and derision for
   this particular edifice. British-born, Seattle-based writer Jonathan
   Raban remarked that "Frank Gehry has created some wonderful buildings,
   like the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, but his Seattle effort, the
   Experience Music Project, is not one of them."^[35] New York Times
   architecture critic Herbert Muschamp described it as "something that
   crawled out of the sea, rolled over, and died".^[36] Forbes magazine
   called it one of the world's 10 ugliest buildings.^[36] Others describe
   it as a "blob"^[37] or call it "The Hemorrhoids".^[35] Despite some
   critical reviews of the structure, the building has been called "a
   fitting backdrop for the world's largest collection of Jimi Hendrix
   memorabilia."^[38] The building's exterior, which features a fusion of
   textures and colors including gold, silver, deep red, blue and a
   "shimmering purple haze",^[39] has been declared "an apt representation
   of the American rock experience."^[40]

Finances

   [edit]

   The museum has had mixed financial success.^[41]^[42] In an effort to
   raise more funds, museum organizers used Allen's extensive art
   collection to create a 2006 exhibit at the museum entitled DoubleTake:
   From Monet to Lichtenstein.^[43] The exhibit included Roy
   Lichtenstein's The Kiss (1962), Pierre-Auguste Renoir's The Reader
   (1877), Vincent van Gogh's Orchard with Peach Trees in Blossom (1888),
   Pablo Picasso's Four Bathers (1921) and several works of art from
   Claude Monet including one of the Water Lilies paintings (1919) and The
   Mula Palace (1908).^[44] Since then the museum has organized numerous
   exhibitions focused more specifically on popular culture, such as Sound
   and Vision: Artists Tell Their Stories, which opened February 28, 2007.
   This brought together both music and science fiction in a single
   exhibit, and drew on the museum's extensive collection of oral history
   recordings.^[45] The museum's recent exhibitions have ranged from
   horror cinema, video games, and black leather jackets to fantasy film
   and literature.

Founders Award

   [edit]

   Since 2007, the Museum of Pop Culture's Founders Award has celebrated
   artists whose "noteworthy contributions continue to nurture the next
   generation of risk-takers". The annual benefit gala is key in funding
   the museum's educational programs, community engagement, and
   exhibitions.^[46] In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the gala had
   to be cancelled and for the first time ever, the event was made free to
   the public, streaming online on December 1, 2020, as MOPOP honored
   Seattle's own Alice in Chains.^[47] The benefit streaming raised more
   than $600,000 for MOPOP in its first night. A compilation featuring
   highlights from the tribute was made available for streaming on Amazon
   Music.^[48]
