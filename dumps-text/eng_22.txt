   Concept that defines the experience of notably positive, negative, or
   improbable events
   For other uses, see Luck (disambiguation).
   "Good luck" redirects here. For other uses, see Good luck
   (disambiguation).
   "Good fortune" redirects here. For other uses, see Good Fortune.
   [250px-Four-leaf_clover.jpg] A four-leaf clover, a rare variant of the
   shamrock, is often considered to bestow good luck.

   Luck is a phenomenon or belief that humans may associate with
   experiencing improbable events, especially improbably positive or
   negative events.^[1]^[2]^[3] Philosophical naturalism, eschewing any
   supernatural explanations, might suggest that positive or negative
   events may happen at any time (due to both random and non-random
   natural and artificial processes), and that even improbable events can
   happen by random chance.^[a] In this view, the epithet "lucky" or
   "unlucky" is a descriptive label that refers to an event's positivity,
   negativity, or improbability.

   Supernatural interpretations of luck consider it to be an attribute of
   a person^[5] or of an object, or the result of a favorable (or
   unfavorable) view manifested by a deity^[6] towards the lucky (or
   unlucky) person. These interpretations often prescribe how luckiness or
   unluckiness can be obtained, such as by carrying a lucky charm or
   offering sacrifices or prayers to a deity. Saying someone is "born
   lucky" may hold different meanings, depending on the interpretation: it
   could simply mean that they have been born into a good family or
   circumstance; or that they habitually experience improbably positive
   events, due to some inherent property, or due to the lifelong favor of
   a god or goddess in a monotheistic or polytheistic religion.

   Many superstitions are associated by superstitious persons with a
   concept of luck,^[7] though such superstitions are often specific to a
   given culture^[8]^[9]^[10] or set of related cultures, and they
   sometimes vary between cultures. For example, lucky symbols include the
   number 7 in Christian-influenced cultures and the number 8 in
   Chinese-influenced cultures. Unlucky symbols and events include
   entering and leaving a house by different doors or breaking a
   mirror^[11] in Greek culture, throwing rocks into a whirlwind in Navajo
   culture,^[12] and ravens in Western culture. Some of these associations
   may derive from related facts or desires. For example, in Western
   culture opening an umbrella indoors might be considered unlucky partly
   because it could poke someone in the eye, whereas shaking hands with a
   chimney sweep might be considered lucky partly because it is a kind but
   unpleasant thing to do given the dirty nature of their work. In Chinese
   and Japanese culture, the association of the number 4 as a homophone
   with the word for death may explain why it is considered unlucky.
   Extremely complicated and sometimes contradictory systems for
   prescribing auspicious and inauspicious times and arrangements of
   things have been devised, for example feng shui in Chinese culture and
   systems of astrology in various cultures around the world.

   Many polytheistic religions feature specific gods or goddesses who are
   associated by adherents with luck, either good or bad. Such deities
   include Fortuna and Felicitas in the Ancient Roman religion (the name
   of the former relating to the words "fortunate" and "unfortunate" in
   English), Dedun in Nubian religion, the Seven Lucky Gods in Japanese
   mythology, mythical American serviceman turned prosperity-god John Frum
   in a Vanuatu cargo-cult,^[13] and the inauspicious Alakshmi and her
   auspicious counterpart Lakshmi^[14] in Hinduism.

Etymology and definition

   [edit]
   [250px-1926WhyBeUnlucky.jpg] 1927 advertisement for lucky jewellery.
   "Why Be Unlucky?".

   The English noun luck appears comparatively late, during the 1480s, as
   a loan from Low German, Dutch or Frisian luk, a short form of gelucke
   (Middle High German gelücke). Compare to old Slavic word lukyj (лукый)
   - appointed by destiny and old Russian luchaj (лучаи) - destiny,
   fortune. It likely entered English as a gambling term, and the context
   of gambling remains detectable in the word's connotations; luck is a
   way of understanding a personal chance event. Luck has three
   aspects:^[15]^[16]^[17]
     * Luck is good or bad.^[18]
     * Luck is the result of chance.^[19]
     * Luck applies to a sentient being.

   Before the adoption of luck at the end of the Middle Ages, Old English
   and Middle English expressed the notion of "good fortune" with the word
   speed (Middle English spede, Old English spēd); speed besides "good
   fortune" had the wider meaning of "prosperity, profit, abundance"; it
   is not associated with the notion of probability or chance but rather
   with that of fate or divine help; a bestower of success can also be
   called speed, as in "Christ be our speed" (William Robertson,
   Phraseologia generalis, 1693).

   The notion of probability was expressed by the Latin loanword chance,
   adopted in Middle English from the late 13th century, literally
   describing an outcome as a "falling" (as it were of dice), via Old
   French cheance from Late Latin cadentia "falling". Fortuna, the Roman
   goddess of fate or luck, was popular as an allegory in medieval times,
   and even though it was not strictly reconcilable with Christian
   theology, it became popular in learned circles of the High Middle Ages
   to portray her as a servant of God in distributing success or failure
   in a characteristically "fickle" or unpredictable way, thus introducing
   the notion of chance.^[citation needed]

Interpretations

   [edit]

   Luck is interpreted and understood in many different ways.

Lack of control

   [edit]

   Luck refers to that which happens to a person beyond that person's
   control. This view incorporates phenomena that are chance happenings, a
   person's place of birth for example, but where there is no uncertainty
   involved, or where the uncertainty is irrelevant. Within this
   framework, one can differentiate between three different types of luck:
    1. Constitutional luck, that is, luck with factors that cannot be
       changed. Place of birth and genetic constitution are typical
       examples.
    2. Circumstantial luck—with factors that are haphazardly brought on.
       Accidents and epidemics are typical examples.
    3. Ignorance luck, that is, luck with factors one does not know about.
       Examples can be identified only in hindsight.

   Circumstantial luck with accidental happenstance of favorable
   discoveries and/or inventions is serendipity.

Fallacy

   [edit]

   Another view holds that "luck is probability taken personally." A
   rationalist approach to luck includes the application of the rules of
   probability and an avoidance of unscientific beliefs. The rationalist
   thinks that the belief in luck is a result of poor reasoning or wishful
   thinking. To a rationalist, a believer in luck who asserts that
   something has influenced his or her luck commits the "post hoc ergo
   propter hoc" logical fallacy: that because two events are connected
   sequentially, they are connected causally as well. In general, this
   fallacy is that:
    1. A luck-attracting event or action happens;
    2. Then a positive outcome happens;
    3. Therefore, the event or action influenced the outcome.

   More contemporary authors writing on the subject believe that the
   definition of good destiny is: One who enjoys good health; has the
   physical and mental capabilities of achieving his goals in life; has
   good appearance, and; has happiness in mind and is not prone to
   accidents.^[20]

   In the rationalist perspective, probability is only affected by
   confirmed causal connections.

   The gambler's fallacy and inverse gambler's fallacy both explain some
   reasoning problems in common beliefs in luck. They involve denying the
   unpredictability of random events: "I haven't rolled a seven all week,
   so I'll definitely roll one tonight".

   Philosopher Daniel Dennett wrote that "luck is mere luck" rather than a
   property of a person or thing.^[21]

Essence

   [edit]
   [250px-Maneki_neko_with_7_Lucky_Gods_by_OiMax_in_Asakusa%2C_Tokyo.jpg]
   Maneki-neko with Seven Lucky gods

   There is also a series of spiritual, or supernatural beliefs regarding
   fortune. These beliefs vary widely from one to another, but most agree
   that luck can be influenced through spiritual means by performing
   certain rituals or by avoiding certain circumstances.

   Luck can also be a belief in an organization of fortunate and
   unfortunate events. Luck is a form of superstition which is interpreted
   differently by different individuals. Carl Jung coined the term
   synchronicity, which he described as "a meaningful coincidence".

   Abrahamic religions believe God controls future events; belief in luck
   or fate is criticised in Isaiah 65:11–12:

   But you who forsake the Lord,
   who forget my holy mountain,
   who set a table for Fortune
   and fill cups of mixed wine for Destiny,
   I will destine you to the sword,
   and all of you shall bow down to the slaughter

   Belief in the extent of Divine Providence varies; most acknowledge
   providence as at least a partial, if not complete influence on luck.
   Christianity, in its early development, accommodated many traditional
   practices which at different times, accepted omens and practiced forms
   of ritual sacrifice in order to divine the will of their supreme being
   or to influence divine favoritism. The concepts of "Divine Grace" or
   "Blessing" as they are described by believers closely resemble what is
   referred to as "luck" by others.

   Mesoamerican religions, such as the Aztecs, Mayans and Incas, had
   particularly strong beliefs regarding the relationship between rituals
   and the gods, which could in a similar sense to Abrahamic religions be
   called luck or providence. In these cultures, human sacrifice (both of
   willing volunteers and captured enemies), as well as self-sacrifice by
   means of bloodletting, could possibly be seen as a way to propitiate
   the gods and earn favor for the city offering the sacrifice. An
   alternative interpretation^[22] would be that the sacrificial blood was
   considered as a necessary element for the gods to maintain the proper
   working order of the universe, in the same way that oil would be
   applied to an automobile to keep it working as designed.

   Many traditional African practices, such as voodoo and hoodoo, have a
   strong belief in superstition. Some of these religions include a belief
   that third parties can influence an individual's luck. Shamans and
   witches are both respected and feared, based on their ability to cause
   good or bad fortune for those in villages near them.

Self-fulfilling prophecy

   [edit]

   Some evidence supports the idea that belief in luck acts like a
   placebo, producing positive thinking and improving people's responses
   to events.

   In personality psychology, people reliably differ from each other
   depending on four key aspects: beliefs in luck, rejection of luck,
   being lucky, and being unlucky.^[23] People who believe in good luck
   are more optimistic, more satisfied with their lives, and have better
   moods.^[23] People who believe they are personally unlucky experience
   more anxiety, and less likely to take advantage of unexpected
   opportunities.^[24] One 2010 study found that golfers who were told
   they were using a "lucky ball" performed better than those who were
   not.^[24]

   Some people intentionally put themselves in situations that increase
   the chances of a serendipitous encounter, such as socializing with
   people who work in different fields.^[24]

Social aspects

   [edit]
   [250px-Wheel_of_fortune.png] Wheel of fortune as depicted in Sebastian
   Brant's book, author Albrecht Dürer

Games

   [edit]
   Main article: Game of chance

   The philosopher Nicholas Rescher has proposed that the luck of
   someone's result in a situation of uncertainty is measured by the
   difference between this party's yield and expectation: λ = Y - E. Thus
   skill enhances expectation and reduces luck. The extent to which
   different games will depend on luck, rather than skill or effort,
   varies considerably. For example, chess does not involve any random
   factors (beyond the determination of which player moves first), while
   the outcome of Snakes and Ladders is entirely based on random dice
   rolls. In poker, especially games with a communal board, pure luck may
   decide a winning hand. Luck in games involving chance is defined as the
   change in a player's equity after a random event such as a die roll or
   card draw.^[25] Luck is positive (good luck) if the player's position
   is improved and negative (bad luck) if it is worsened. A poker player
   who is doing well (playing successfully, winning) is said to be
   "running good".^[26]

   Almost all sports contain elements of luck. A statistical analysis in
   the book The Success Equation attempted to elucidate the differing
   balance between skill and luck with respect to how teams finished in
   the major North American sports leagues. This analysis concluded that,
   on a luck-skill continuum, the NBA had the most skill-dependant result
   while that of the NHL was most luck-dependant.^[27]

Lotteries

   [edit]
   Main article: Lottery

   A defining feature of a lottery is that winners are selected purely by
   chance. Marketing and other discussions regarding lotteries often
   mention luck but tend to underplay the actual prospects of winning,
   which are usually millions to one against.^[28]

Means of resolving issues

   [edit]

   "Leaving it to chance" is sometimes a way of resolving issues for
   example, where there are two possible outcomes, flipping a coin may
   determine the outcome. This practice has gone on for thousands of
   years, a common contemporary example is the coin toss at the start of a
   sporting event which may determine who goes first.^[29]

Numerology

   [edit]
   Main article: Numerology

   See also: Triskaidekaphobia

   Most cultures consider some numbers to be lucky or unlucky. This is
   found to be particularly strong in Asian cultures, where the obtaining
   of "lucky" telephone numbers, automobile license plate numbers, and
   household addresses (such as those which contain the digit 6 or 8) are
   actively sought, sometimes at great monetary expense.

   Numerology, as it relates to luck, is closer to an art than to a
   science, yet numerologists, astrologists or psychics may disagree. It
   is interrelated to astrology, and to some degree to parapsychology and
   spirituality and is based on converting virtually anything material
   into a pure number, using that number in an attempt to detect something
   meaningful about reality, and trying to predict or calculate the future
   based on lucky numbers. Numerology is folkloric by nature and started
   when humans first learned to count. Through human history it was, and
   still is, practiced by many cultures of the world from traditional
   fortune-telling to on-line psychic reading. Dudley describes numerology
   as, "the delusion that numbers have power over events."^[30]

Science

   [edit]

   Different thinkers like Thomas Kuhn have discussed the role of chance
   in scientific discoveries. Richard Wiseman did a ten-year scientific
   study into the nature of luck that has revealed that, to a large
   extent, people make their own good and bad fortune. His research
   revealed that "Lucky people generate their own good fortune via four
   basic principles. They are skilled at creating and noticing chance
   opportunities, making lucky decisions by listening to their intuition,
   creating self-fulfilling prophecies via positive expectations, and
   adopting a resilient attitude that transforms bad luck into good."^[31]
   Researchers have suggested that good luck and good mood often co-occur
   (Duong & Ohtsuka, 2000)^[32] and that people who believe themselves to
   be lucky are often comparatively happy and optimistic whereas people
   who believe themselves to be unlucky may feel comparatively anxious and
   depressed (Day & Maltby, 2003; Wiseman, 2003).^[31]^[33] Luck can also
   correlate with superstitious behaviors that increase opportunities of
   good fortune occurring like avoiding walking under ladders or blowing
   left and right for safe travels before crossing train tracks, which
   inadvertently increases your chances of seeing an oncoming
   train.^[34]^[35]

   Although previous studies have explored the antecedents and
   consequences of luck using attribution theory (e. g., Fischoff, 1976;
   Weiner et al., 1987),^[36]^[37] personality variables (Darke &
   Freedman, 1997a;b),^[38] and more recently a cognitive priming approach
   (DeMarree et al., 2005; Kramer & Block, 2008) research on the
   underlying mechanism of how luck influences consumer judgment and
   behavior has been noticeably absent in the extant literature. Moreover,
   in much of this previous work, luck is manipulated in a way that is
   very likely to elicit positive affect as well. Thus, it is difficult to
   articulate whether the observed effects of luck are due to chronic
   beliefs about luck, temporary changes in how lucky people feel, or
   because of changes caused by the positive affect that is experienced.
   Their research showed that priming participants subliminally with
   luck-related stimuli made them feel luckier and happier. It was also
   found that the effects of priming luck using subliminal messages
   increased participants' estimates of the likelihood of favorable
   events, their participation in lotteries, the amount of money they
   invested in relatively risky financial options and these effects
   appeared to be mediated by temporary changes in perceptions of luck
   rather than by affect.^[39]^[40]

In religion and mythology

   [edit]

Buddhism

   [edit]

   Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, taught his followers not to
   believe in luck. He taught that all things which happen must have a
   cause, either material or spiritual, and do not occur due to luck,
   chance or fate. The idea of moral causality, karma (Pali: kamma), is
   central in Buddhism. In the Sutta Nipata, the Buddha is recorded as
   having said the following about selling luck:

     Whereas some religious men, while living of food provided by the
     faithful make their living by such low arts, such wrong means of
     livelihood as palmistry, divining by signs, interpreting dreams ...
     bringing good or bad luck ... invoking the goodness of luck ...
     picking the lucky site for a building, the monk Gautama refrains
     from such low arts, such wrong means of livelihood. D.I, 9–12^[41]

   Belief in luck is prevalent in many predominantly Buddhist countries.
   In Thailand, Buddhists may wear verses (takrut) or lucky amulets which
   have been blessed by monks for protection against harm.^[42]

Christianity and Judaism

   [edit]

   The book of Proverbs 16:33 states that "the lot is cast into the lap,
   but its every decision is from the Lord". Ecclesiastes 9:11 states (in
   a passage that describes events with different outcomes - e.g. a race,
   a battle, the gaining of wealth and favour) that "time and chance
   happeneth to them all". Whilst the latter passage from Ecclesiastes
   suggests no things in human affairs are certain, the extract from
   Proverbs indicates that the outcome of something as apparently random
   as the rolling of dice or the tossing of a coin remains subject to
   God's will or sovereignty. In his book God, Chance and Purpose: Can God
   have it both ways?,^[43] Bartholomew argues that chance is part of
   God's creation but that not even God can accurately predict what chance
   will do.^[44]

   God's sovereignty involves two aspects. God's active will or
   sovereignty would involve something God causes to happen such as the
   leading of wicked King Ahab into battle (2 Chronicles 18:18-19). Ahab's
   death was not merely the result of a randomly shot arrow, but as 2
   Chronicles 18 reveals, God actively directed the events that led Ahab
   into battle and used that randomly shot arrow to accomplish his
   intended will for Ahab that day.^[45]

   God's passive will involves God allowing, rather than causing,
   something to happen. Chapter 1 of the book of Job illustrates this in
   what God allowed Satan to do in the life of Job.^[46] It is also
   involved in the evil that God allowed Joseph's brothers to do to Joseph
   in order to accomplish a greater good, a good not apparent to Joseph
   until years later (Genesis 50:20).^[47]

Hinduism

   [edit]

   In Hinduism the Bhagavad-Gita values "Purushartha" more than mere Luck
   or Fate.

   The Gita says; "Set thy heart upon selfless performance of thy natural
   duty (Svakarma, Svadharma), but never on its reward. Work not for a
   reward; but never cease to do thy work" (Gita, 2.47).^[48]

   There are five causes of all actions as given in the Samkhya wisdom;
   says Gita—

   "The physical body (adhisthana), the lower 'I am' (karta), the means of
   perception (karanam), the varied multiple efforts (vividhasch pruthak
   cheshta) and the Cosmic Wheel of Action (daivam), these five sources
   together are responsible for success or failure of any action" ( Gita,
   18 . 14–15 ).^[49]

   Here the word "daivam" does not mean luck, fate, fortune, providence,
   or destiny. None of these English words are the exact synonym for the
   Sanskrit word "Daivam" here. "Daivam" is the Cosmic Wheel of Action
   (Kshara-gati, Apara-Prakriti, Maya) that keeps the perfect account of
   our past and present actions.

   A man who says "Nothing is impossible for me; I am the only hero of all
   these achievements; who else is there like me?" He is a man of clouded
   vision and he does not see the Truth.

Islam

   [edit]

   The definition which is much closer to the concept of luck in Islam is
   "a force that brings good fortune or adversity" Quran 17:13: "And (for)
   every man We have fastened to him his fate (fortune) in his neck, and
   We will bring forth for him (on the) Day (of) the Resurrection a record
   which he will find wide open". A very long discussion continues on how
   this prefixed destiny, fortune or luck defines attitudes and living
   behavior and so as to how much amends one can make in this
   predetermined fate by one's own contribution through positive actions
   in accordance with the teachings of Islam. There is no concept of luck
   in Islam other than actions determined by Allah based on the merit of
   the choice made by human beings. It is stated in the Qur'an (Sura:
   Adh-Dhariyat (The Winds that Scatter) verse:22) that one's sustenance
   is pre-determined in heaven when the Lord says: "And in the heaven is
   your provision and that which ye are promised." One should supplicate
   to Allah to better one's life rather than hold faith in un-Islamic acts
   such as using "lucky charms". In the Arabic language there is a word
   which directly means "luck", which is حظ ḥaẓẓ, and a related word for
   "lucky", محظوظ maḥẓūẓ. It is also forbidden to believe in luck or
   anything else related to luck, as it is classified as shirk
   (associating partners to Allah or giving any share of any attribution
   which belongs to Allah and Allah alone).^[citation needed]

   The Tunisians retain some native beliefs of Berber origin such as the
   evil eye.^[50] A number of practices, such as shutters painted blue are
   also used to repel evil spirits.^[51]

Belief measurement

   [edit]

   [250px-Horseshoe_lucky_on_door.jpg] A horseshoe on a door is regarded a
   protective talisman in some cultures.

   Darke and Freedman (1997)^[52] were the first researchers
   systematically to address directly both the concept and the measurement
   of belief in luck as a deterministic and personal attribute. They
   define luck belief as the perception that good luck is "a somewhat
   stable characteristic that consistently favors some people but not
   others".^[52] They define disbelief in luck as "a tendency to agree
   with the rational view of luck as random and unreliable" (p. 490). To
   capture their unidimensional definition of irrational luck belief,
   Darke and Freedman developed a 12-item measure.^[52] Unfortunately,
   they found their measure "does not seem particularly good at
   distinguishing between people who [say] they [are] typically lucky from
   those who [say] they [are] typically unlucky".^[52] They also found
   factor analyses of their measure produced a multi-component
   solution,^[52] as did Prendergast and Thompson (2008).^[53]

   André (2006)^[54] proposed a model of luck-related perceptions that
   includes separate positive and negative beliefs. She found the positive
   and negative components of personal luck beliefs correlate highly,
   suggesting they are conceptually very close or in fact the same. Maltby
   et al. (2008)^[55] proposed a six-dimensional model of beliefs around
   luck, but empirical analyses supported only a four-dimensional model:
   belief in being personally lucky; belief in being personally unlucky;
   general belief in luck; and rejection of belief in luck.^[citation

   [250px-BarnstarProud.jpg] A barnstar, mounted on a wall, is seen as a
   lucky symbol in some parts of North America.

   Thompson and Prendergast (2013)^[56] clarified the concepts of belief
   in luck and belief in personal luckiness. They addressed the logical
   problem that nobody who disbelieves in luck could consider themselves
   lucky by differentiating between belief in luck as a deterministic
   phenomenon that affects the future, on one hand, and on the other,
   belief in personal luckiness as an appraisal of how fortunately or
   otherwise chance events in the past might have turned out. They
   developed and validated an internationally applicable scale to measure,
   respectively, belief in luck and personal luckiness constructs. They
   found no correlation between the constructs and no evidence of a
   distinction between positive and negative aspects of each, suggesting
   they represent two discrete and unidimensional constructs. Belief in
   luck and personal luckiness were also found to correlate differently
   with personality and psychological variables, such as the Big Five and
   affect.^[citation needed]
