   Plant tissue culture is a collection of techniques used to maintain or
   grow plant cells, tissues, or organs under sterile conditions on a
   nutrient culture medium of known composition. It is widely used to
   produce clones of a plant in a method known as micropropagation.
   Different techniques in plant tissue culture may offer certain
   advantages over traditional methods of propagation, including:

     * The production of exact copies of plants that produce particularly
       good flowers, fruits, or other desirable traits.
     * To quickly produce mature plants.
     * To produce a large number of plants in a reduced space.
     * The production of multiples of plants in the absence of seeds or
       necessary pollinators to produce seeds.
     * The regeneration of whole plants from plant cells that have been
       genetically modified.
     * The production of plants in sterile containers allows them to be
       moved with greatly reduced chances of transmitting diseases, pests,
       and pathogens.
     * The production of plants from seeds that otherwise have very low
       chances of germinating and growing, e.g., orchids and Nepenthes.
     * To clean particular plants of viral and other infections and to
       quickly multiply these plants as 'cleaned stock' for horticulture
       and agriculture.
     * Reproduce recalcitrant plants required for land restoration
     * Storage of genetic plant material to safeguard native plant
       species.

   Plant tissue culture relies on the fact that many plant parts have the
   ability to regenerate into a whole plant (cells of those regenerative
   plant parts are called totipotent cells which can differentiate into
   various specialized cells). Single cells, plant cells without cell
   walls (protoplasts), pieces of leaves, stems or roots can often be used
   to generate a new plant on culture media given the required nutrients
   and plant hormones.

Techniques used for plant tissue culture in vitro

   [edit]

   Preparation of plant tissue for tissue culture is performed under
   aseptic conditions under HEPA filtered air provided by a laminar flow
   cabinet. Thereafter, the tissue is grown in sterile containers, such as
   Petri dishes or flasks in a growth room with controlled temperature and
   light intensity. Living plant materials from the environment are
   naturally contaminated on their surfaces (and sometimes interiors) with
   microorganisms, so their surfaces are sterilized in chemical solutions
   (usually alcohol and sodium or calcium hypochlorite)^[1] before
   suitable samples (known as explants) are taken. The sterile explants
   are then usually placed on the surface of a sterile solid culture
   medium but are sometimes placed directly into a sterile liquid medium,
   particularly when cell suspension cultures are desired. Solid and
   liquid media are generally composed of inorganic salts plus a few
   organic nutrients, vitamins, and plant hormones. Solid media are
   prepared from liquid media with the addition of a gelling agent,
   usually purified agar.

   The composition of the medium, particularly the plant hormones and the
   nitrogen source (nitrate versus ammonium salts or amino acids) have
   profound effects on the morphology of the tissues that grow from the
   initial explant. For example, an excess of auxin will often result in a
   proliferation of roots, while an excess of cytokinin may yield shoots.
   A balance of both auxin and cytokinin will often produce an unorganised
   growth of cells, or callus, but the morphology of the outgrowth will
   depend on the plant species as well as the medium composition. As
   cultures grow, pieces are typically sliced off and subcultured onto new
   media to allow for growth or to alter the morphology of the culture.
   The skill and experience of the tissue culturist are important in
   judging which pieces to culture and which to discard.

   As shoots emerge from a culture, they may be sliced off and rooted with
   auxin to produce plantlets which, when mature, can be transferred to
   potting soil for further growth in the greenhouse as normal plants.^[2]

Regeneration pathways

   [edit]

   The specific differences in the regeneration potential of different
   organs and explants have various explanations. The significant factors
   include differences in the stage of the cells in the cell cycle, the
   availability of or ability to transport endogenous growth regulators,
   and the metabolic capabilities of the cells. The most commonly used
   tissue explants are the meristematic ends of the plants like the stem
   tip, axillary bud tip, and root tip.^[3] These tissues have high rates
   of cell division and either concentrate or produce required
   growth-regulating substances including auxins and cytokinins.

   Shoot regeneration efficiency in tissue culture is usually a
   quantitative trait that often varies between plant species and within a
   plant species among subspecies, varieties, cultivars, or ecotypes.
   Therefore, tissue culture regeneration can become complicated
   especially when many regeneration procedures have to be developed for
   different genotypes within the same species.

   The three common pathways of plant tissue culture regeneration are
   propagation from preexisting meristems (shoot culture or nodal
   culture), organogenesis, and non-zygotic embryogenesis.

   The propagation of shoots or nodal segments is usually performed in
   four stages for mass production of plantlets through in vitro
   vegetative multiplication but organogenesis is a standard method of
   micropropagation that involves tissue regeneration of adventitious
   organs or axillary buds directly or indirectly from the explants.
   Non-zygotic embryogenesis is a noteworthy developmental pathway that is
   highly comparable to that of zygotic embryos and it is an important
   pathway for producing somaclonal variants, developing artificial seeds,
   and synthesizing metabolites. Due to the single-cell origin of
   non-zygotic embryos, they are preferred in several regeneration systems
   for micropropagation, ploidy manipulation, gene transfer, and synthetic
   seed production. Nonetheless, tissue regeneration via organogenesis has
   also proved to be advantageous for studying regulatory mechanisms of
   plant development.

Choice of explant

   [edit]

   The tissue obtained from a plant to be cultured is called an explant.

   Explants can be taken from many different parts of a plant, including
   portions of shoots, leaves, stems, flowers, roots, single
   undifferentiated cells, and from many types of mature cells provided
   they still contain living cytoplasm and nuclei and are able to
   de-differentiate and resume cell division. This has given rise to the
   concept of totipotency of plant cells.^[4]^[5] However, this is not
   true for all cells or for all plants.^[6] In many species explants of
   various organs vary in their rates of growth and regeneration, while
   some do not grow at all. The choice of explant material also determines
   if the plantlets developed via tissue culture are haploid or diploid.
   Also, the risk of microbial contamination is increased with
   inappropriate explants.

   The first method involving the meristems and induction of multiple
   shoots is the preferred method for the micropropagation industry since
   the risks of somaclonal variation (genetic variation induced in tissue
   culture) are minimal when compared to the other two methods. Somatic
   embryogenesis is a method that has the potential to be several times
   higher in multiplication rates and is amenable to handling in liquid
   culture systems like bioreactors.

   Some explants, like the root tip, are hard to isolate and are
   contaminated with soil microflora that becomes problematic during the
   tissue culture process. Certain soil microflora can form tight
   associations with the root systems, or even grow within the root. Soil
   particles bound to roots are difficult to remove without injury to the
   roots that then allows a microbial attack. These associated microflora
   will generally overgrow the tissue culture medium before there is
   significant growth of plant tissue.

   Some cultured tissues are slow in their growth. For them there would be
   two options: (i) Optimizing the culture medium; (ii) Culturing highly
   responsive tissues or varieties.^[7] Necrosis can spoil cultured
   tissues. Generally, plant varieties differ in susceptibility to tissue
   culture necrosis. Thus, by culturing highly responsive varieties (or
   tissues) it can be managed.^[7]

   Aerial (above soil) explants are also rich in undesirable microflora.
   However, they are more easily removed from the explant by gentle
   rinsing, and the remainder usually can be killed by surface
   sterilization. Most of the surface microflora do not form tight
   associations with the plant tissue. Such associations can usually be
   found by visual inspection as a mosaic, de-colorization, or localized
   necrosis on the surface of the explant.

   An alternative for obtaining uncontaminated explants is to take
   explants from seedlings which are aseptically grown from
   surface-sterilized seeds. The hard surface of the seed is less
   permeable to the penetration of harsh surface sterilizing agents, such
   as hypochlorite, so the acceptable conditions of sterilization used for
   seeds can be much more stringent than for vegetative tissues.

   Tissue-cultured plants are clones. If the original mother plant used to
   produce the first explants is susceptible to a pathogen or
   environmental condition, the entire crop would be susceptible to the
   same problem. Conversely, any positive traits would remain within the
   line also.

Applications of plant tissue culture

   [edit]

   Plant tissue culture is used widely in the plant sciences, forestry,
   and horticulture. Applications include:
     * The commercial production of plants used as potting, landscape, and
       florist subjects, which uses meristem and shoot culture to produce
       large numbers of identical individuals.^[8]
     * To conserve rare or endangered plant species.^[9]^[10]
     * A plant breeder may use tissue culture to screen cells rather than
       plants for advantageous characters, e.g. herbicide
       resistance/tolerance, detection of chimeras at an early
       developmental stage.^[11]
     * Large-scale growth of plant cells in liquid culture in bioreactors
       for production of valuable compounds, like plant-derived secondary
       metabolites and recombinant proteins used as
       biopharmaceuticals.^[12]
     * To cross distantly related species by protoplast fusion and
       regeneration of the novel hybrid.
     * To rapidly study the molecular basis for physiological,
       biochemical, and reproductive mechanisms in plants, for example in
       vitro selection for stress-tolerant plants.^[13]
     * To cross-pollinate distantly related species and then tissue
       culture the resulting embryo which would otherwise normally die
       (Embryo Rescue).
     * For chromosome doubling and induction of polyploidy,^[14] for
       example doubled haploids, tetraploids, and other forms of
       polyploids. This is usually achieved by the application of
       antimitotic agents such as colchicine or oryzalin.
     * As a tissue for transformation, followed by either short-term
       testing of genetic constructs or regeneration of transgenic plants.
     * Certain techniques such as meristem tip culture can be used to
       produce clean plant material from virused stock, such as
       sugarcane,^[15] potatoes and many species of soft fruit.
     * Production of identical sterile hybrid species can be obtained.
     * Large scale production of artificial seeds through somatic
       embryogenesis^[16]^[17]
