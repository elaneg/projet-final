What is cultivation?

   Cultivation is any process that involves turning over or tilling the
   soil. It can include:
     * pasture renewal
     * cropping (such as growing maize)
     * intensive cropping (such as commercial vegetable growing).

   Cultivation provides us with food crops and new pastures. But it also
   reduces the organic matter in soil, and can lead to increased
   erosion. Waikato Regional Council recommends growing annual cover
   crops, reducing cultivation and adding organic matter (compost, manure)
   to soil to help restore soil organic matter.

What cultivation does to soil

   Soil organic matter is an indicator of soil quality. We estimate it by
   measuring the organic carbon in soils. Regular cultivation exposes more
   soil to the air, which mineralises soil organic matter. This means that
   the soil’s organic carbon is lost as the gas carbon dioxide (CO[2]).

   Waikato dairy pasture soils still have good amounts of soil organic
   matter – but some cropping soils have lost up to 60 percent.

   Organic carbon levels in cropped soils, such as those in Patumahoe,
   have reduced to amongst the lowest in the Waikato Region. Six years of
   maize cropping in Horotiu and Puniu soils have led to organic carbon
   decreases of 40 and 53 percent respectively.

   Cultivation also leaves soils vulnerable to erosion. The compacted
   soils left in wheel tracks often act as channels for water. When it
   rains, water can then undercut and remove the surrounding soil.

Why organic matter is important

   Long term protection and improvement of soil organic matter is needed
   to maintain:
     * soil structure
     * microbial activity in the soil
     * soil buffering (the ability of a soil to stay at the same acidity)
     * nutrient storage
     * water retention.

   Soils with low organic matter have low microbial activity. The soil
   microbes break down harmful chemicals such as pesticides. When soils
   have low microbial activity and low water holding ability they are more
   likely to leach pesticides. This means that cropping soils leak
   pesticides more readily than other soils.

   Soils that have lost a lot of their organic matter need more and more
   fertiliser and water to maintain productivity. To find out more about
   preventing fertiliser runoff read the NZ Fertiliser Manufacturer’s
   Research Association Code of Practice for Fertiliser Use.

Increasing soil organic matter

   Reducing cultivation and soil disturbance minimises the loss of organic
   carbon. By implementing reduced tillage or no-tillage, where possible,
   soil structure and soil organic matter will be preserved. Erosion risks
   will be reduced as well.

   Check out the NZ Fertiliser Manufacturers' Research Association Code of
   Practice for Fertiliser Use.

   To increase the organic matter in the soil you can:
     * grow annual cover crops between productive crops – these cover
       crops can then be mulched into the ground
     * apply compost, organic manure or effluent to the soil.

   With more organic matter, soil is better able to store nutrients and
   water, and has improved soil structure. This makes soil more resistant
   to erosion by wind and water.

Cultivation and peat soil

   Cultivation causes peat to shrink twice as fast as it would under
   pasture, and should be avoided where possible. If cultivation is done
   correctly during pasture renewal, it won’t need to be done as often.
   Managing your pasture well also reduces the need for pasture renewal.
