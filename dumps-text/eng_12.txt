   Dune is a 1965 epic science fiction novel by American author Frank
   Herbert, originally published as two separate serials (1963–64 novel
   Dune World and 1965 novel Prophet of Dune) in Analog magazine. It tied
   with Roger Zelazny's This Immortal for the Hugo Award for Best Novel
   and won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1966. It is the
   first installment of the Dune Chronicles. It is one of the world's
   best-selling science fiction novels.^[4]

   Dune is set in the distant future in a feudal interstellar society,
   descended from terrestrial humans, in which various noble houses
   control planetary fiefs. It tells the story of young Paul Atreides,
   whose family reluctantly accepts the stewardship of the planet Arrakis.
   While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert
   wasteland, it is the only source of melange or "spice", an enormously
   valuable drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities. Melange
   is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind of
   multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug provides.
   As melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control of the planet is a
   coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story explores the multilayered
   interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human
   emotion as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle
   for the control of Arrakis and its spice.

   Herbert wrote five sequels: Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor
   of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapterhouse: Dune. Following Herbert's
   death in 1986, his son Brian Herbert and author Kevin J. Anderson
   continued the series in over a dozen additional novels since 1999.

   Adaptations of the novel to cinema have been notoriously difficult and
   complicated. In the 1970s, cult filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky
   attempted to make a film based on the novel. After three years of
   development, the project was canceled due to a constantly growing
   budget. In 1984, a film adaptation directed by David Lynch was released
   to mostly negative responses from critics and failure at the box
   office, although it later developed a cult following. The book was also
   adapted into the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries Frank Herbert's Dune
   and its 2003 sequel, Frank Herbert's Children of Dune (the latter of
   which combines the events of Dune Messiah and Children of Dune). A
   second film adaptation, directed by Denis Villeneuve, was released on
   October 21, 2021, to positive reviews. It went on to be nominated for
   ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture, ultimately winning six.
   Villeneuve's film covers roughly the first half of the original novel;
   a sequel, which covers the second half, was released on March 1, 2024,
   to critical acclaim. Both films have grossed over $1 billion worldwide.

   The series has also been used as the basis for several board,
   role-playing, and video games.

   Since 2009, the names of planets from the Dune novels have been adopted
   for the real-life nomenclature of plains and other features on Saturn's
   moon Titan.

Origins

   [edit]
   [250px-USA_Oregon_Dunes.jpg] The Oregon Dunes, near Florence, Oregon,
   served as an inspiration for the Dune saga, specifically including the
   landscape on Arrakis.

   After his novel The Dragon in the Sea was published in 1957, Herbert
   traveled to Florence, Oregon, at the north end of the Oregon Dunes.
   Here, the United States Department of Agriculture was attempting to use
   poverty grasses to stabilize the sand dunes. Herbert claimed in a
   letter to his literary agent, Lurton Blassingame, that the moving dunes
   could "swallow whole cities, lakes, rivers, highways."^[5] Herbert's
   article on the dunes, "They Stopped the Moving Sands", was never
   completed (and only published decades later in The Road to Dune), but
   its research sparked Herbert's interest in ecology and deserts.^[6]

   Herbert further drew inspiration from Native American mentors like
   "Indian Henry" (as Herbert referred to the man to his son; likely a
   Henry Martin of the Hoh tribe) and Howard Hansen. Both Martin and
   Hansen grew up on the Quileute reservation near Herbert's hometown.
   According to historian Daniel Immerwahr, Hansen regularly shared his
   writing with Herbert. "White men are eating the earth," Hansen told
   Herbert in 1958, after sharing a piece on the effect of logging on the
   Quileute reservation. "They're gonna turn this whole planet into a
   wasteland, just like North Africa." The world could become a "big
   dune," Herbert responded in agreement.^[7]

   Herbert was also interested in the idea of the superhero mystique and
   messiahs. He believed that feudalism was a natural condition humans
   fell into, where some led and others gave up the responsibility of
   making decisions and just followed orders. He found that desert
   environments have historically given birth to several major religions
   with messianic impulses. He decided to join his interests together so
   he could play religious and ecological ideas against each other. In
   addition, he was influenced by the story of T. E. Lawrence and the
   "messianic overtones" in Lawrence's involvement in the Arab Revolt
   during World War I. In an early version of Dune, the hero was actually
   very similar to Lawrence of Arabia, but Herbert decided the plot was
   too straightforward and added more layers to his story.^[8]

   Herbert drew heavy inspiration also from Lesley Blanch's The Sabres of
   Paradise (1960), a narrative history recounting a mid-19th-century
   conflict in the Caucasus between rugged caucasian Muslim tribes and the
   expanding Russian Empire.^[9] Language used on both sides of that
   conflict become terms in Herbert's world—chakobsa, a Caucasian hunting
   language, becomes a battle language of humans spread across the galaxy;
   kanly, a word for blood feud in the 19th-century Caucasus, represents a
   feud between Dune's noble Houses; sietch and tabir are both words for
   camp borrowed from Ukrainian Cossacks (of the Pontic–Caspian
   steppe).^[9]

   Herbert also borrowed some lines which Blanch stated were Caucasian
   proverbs. "To kill with the point lacked artistry", used by Blanch to
   describe the Caucasus peoples' love of swordsmanship, becomes in Dune
   "Killing with the tip lacks artistry", a piece of advice given to a
   young Paul during his training. "Polish comes from the city, wisdom
   from the hills", a Caucasian aphorism, turns into a desert expression:
   "Polish comes from the cities, wisdom from the desert".^[9]

   Another significant source of inspiration for Dune was Herbert's
   experiences with psilocybin and his hobby of cultivating mushrooms,
   according to mycologist Paul Stamets's account of meeting Herbert in
   the 1980s:^[10]

     Frank went on to tell me that much of the premise of Dune—the magic
     spice (spores) that allowed the bending of space (tripping), the
     giant sand worms (maggots digesting mushrooms), the eyes of the
     Freman (the cerulean blue of Psilocybe mushrooms), the mysticism of
     the female spiritual warriors, the Bene Gesserits (influenced by the
     tales of Maria Sabina and the sacred mushroom cults of Mexico)—came
     from his perception of the fungal life cycle, and his imagination
     was stimulated through his experiences with the use of magic
     mushrooms.

   Herbert spent the next five years researching, writing, and revising.
   He published a three-part serial Dune World in the monthly Analog, from
   December 1963 to February 1964. The serial was accompanied by several
   illustrations that were not published again. After an interval of a
   year, he published the much slower-paced five-part The Prophet of Dune
   in the January–May 1965 issues.^[11]^[12] The first serial became "Book
   One: Dune" in the final published Dune novel, and the second serial was
   divided into "Book Two: Muad'dib" and "Book Three: The Prophet". The
   serialized version was expanded, reworked, and submitted to more than
   twenty publishers, each of whom rejected it. The novel, Dune, was
   finally accepted and published in August 1965 by Chilton Books, a
   printing house better known for publishing auto repair manuals.^[13]
   Sterling Lanier, an editor at Chilton, had seen Herbert's manuscript
   and had urged his company to take a risk in publishing the book.
   However, the first printing, priced at $5.95 (equivalent to $59.37 in
   2024), did not sell well and was poorly received by critics as being
   atypical of science fiction at the time. Chilton considered the
   publication of Dune a write-off and Lanier was fired.^[14] Over the
   course of time, the book gained critical acclaim, and its popularity
   spread by word-of-mouth to allow Herbert to start working full time on
   developing the sequels to Dune, elements of which were already written
   alongside Dune.^[15]

   At first Herbert considered using Mars as setting for his novel, but
   eventually decided to use a fictional planet instead. His son Brian
   said that "Readers would have too many preconceived ideas about that
   planet, due to the number of stories that had been written about
   it."^[16]

   Herbert dedicated his work "to the people whose labors go beyond ideas
   into the realm of 'real materials'—to the dry-land ecologists, wherever
   they may be, in whatever time they work, this effort at prediction is
   dedicated in humility and admiration."^[17]

Plot

   [edit]

   Duke Leto Atreides of House Atreides, ruler of the ocean world Caladan,
   is assigned by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV to serve as fief ruler
   of the planet Arrakis. Although Arrakis is a harsh and inhospitable
   desert planet, it is of enormous importance because it is the only
   planetary source of melange, or the "spice", a unique and incredibly
   valuable substance that extends human youth, vitality and lifespan. It
   is also through the consumption of spice that Spacing Guild Navigators
   are able to effect safe interstellar travel through a limited ability
   to see into the future. The Emperor is jealous of the Duke's rising
   popularity in the Landsraad, the council of Great Houses, and sees
   House Atreides as a potential rival and threat. He conspires with House
   Harkonnen, the former stewards of Arrakis and the longstanding enemies
   of the Atreides, to destroy Leto and his family after their arrival.
   Leto is aware his assignment is a trap of some kind, but is compelled
   to obey the Emperor's orders anyway.

   Leto's concubine Lady Jessica is an acolyte of the Bene Gesserit, an
   exclusively female group that pursues mysterious political aims and
   wields seemingly superhuman physical and mental abilities, such as the
   ability to control their bodies down to the cellular level, and also
   decide the sex of their children. Though Jessica was instructed by the
   Bene Gesserit to bear a daughter as part of their breeding program, out
   of love for Leto she bore him a son, Paul. From a young age, Paul is
   trained in warfare by Leto's aides, the elite soldiers Duncan Idaho and
   Gurney Halleck. Thufir Hawat, the Duke's Mentat (human computers, able
   to store vast amounts of data and perform advanced calculations on
   demand), has instructed Paul in the ways of political intrigue. Jessica
   has also trained her son in Bene Gesserit disciplines.

   Paul's prophetic dreams interest Jessica's superior, the Reverend
   Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She subjects Paul to a deadly test. She
   holds a poisoned needle, the gom jabbar, to his neck, ready to strike
   should he withdraw his hand from a box which creates extreme pain by
   nerve induction but causes no physical damage. This is to test Paul's
   ability to endure the pain and override his animal instincts, proving
   that he is, in Bene Gesserit eyes, human. Paul passes, enduring greater
   pain than any woman has ever been subjected to in the test.

   Paul and his parents travel with their household to occupy Arrakeen,
   the capital on Arrakis. Leto learns of the dangers involved in
   harvesting the spice, which is protected by giant sandworms, and seeks
   to negotiate with the planet's indigenous Fremen people, seeing them as
   a valuable ally rather than foes. Soon after the Atreides' arrival,
   Harkonnen forces attack, joined by the Emperor's ferocious Sardaukar
   troops in disguise. Leto is betrayed by his personal physician, the Suk
   doctor Wellington Yueh, who delivers a drugged Leto to the Baron
   Vladimir Harkonnen and his twisted Mentat, Piter De Vries.

   Yueh, who delivered Leto under duress, arranges for Jessica and Paul to
   escape into the desert. Duncan is killed helping them flee, and they
   are subsequently presumed dead in a sandstorm by the Harkonnens. Yueh
   replaces one of Leto's teeth with a poison gas capsule, hoping Leto can
   kill Baron Harkonnen during their encounter. Piter kills Yueh, and the
   Baron narrowly avoids the gas (due to his defensive shield), which
   kills Leto, Piter, and the others in the room. The Baron forces Thufir
   to take over Piter's position by dosing him with a long-lasting, fatal
   poison and threatening to withhold the regular antidote doses. While he
   follows the Baron's orders, Thufir works secretly to undermine the
   Harkonnens.

   Having fled into the desert, Paul is exposed to high concentrations of
   spice and has visions through which he realizes he has significant
   powers (as a result of the Bene Gesserit breeding scheme). He foresees
   potential futures in which he lives among the Fremen before leading
   them on a holy war across the known universe. Paul reveals that
   Jessica's father is Baron Harkonnen, a secret kept from her by the Bene
   Gesserit.

   Paul and Jessica traverse the desert in search of Fremen people. After
   being captured by a Fremen band, Paul and Jessica agree to teach the
   Fremen the Bene Gesserit fighting technique known to the Fremen as the
   "weirding way" and are accepted into the community of Sietch Tabr. Paul
   proves his manhood by killing a Fremen man named Jamis in a ritualistic
   crysknife fight and chooses the Fremen name Muad'Dib, while Jessica
   opts to undergo a ritual to become a Reverend Mother by drinking and
   neutralizing the poisonous Water of Life. Pregnant with Leto's
   daughter, she inadvertently causes her unborn daughter Alia to become
   infused with the same powers in the womb. Paul takes a Fremen lover,
   Chani, who bears him a son he names Leto.

   Two years pass, and Paul's powerful prescience manifests, which
   confirms to the Fremen that he is their prophesied "Lisan al-Gaib"
   messiah, a legend planted by the Bene Gesserit's Missionaria
   Protectiva. Paul embraces his father's belief that the Fremen could be
   a powerful fighting force to take back Arrakis, but also sees that if
   he does not control them, their jihad could consume the entire
   universe. Word of the new Fremen leader reaches both the Baron and the
   Emperor as spice production falls due to their increasingly destructive
   raids. The Baron encourages his brutish nephew Glossu "Beast" Rabban to
   rule with an iron fist, hoping the contrast with his shrewder nephew
   Feyd-Rautha will make the latter popular among the people of Arrakis
   when he eventually replaces Rabban. The Emperor, suspecting the Baron
   of trying to create troops more powerful than the Sardaukar to seize
   power, sends spies to Arrakis. Thufir uses the opportunity to sow seeds
   of doubt in the Baron about the Emperor's true plans, putting further
   strain on their alliance.

   Gurney, who survived the Harkonnen coup and became a smuggler, reunites
   with Paul and Jessica after a Fremen raid on his harvester. Believing
   Jessica to be a traitor, Gurney threatens to kill her but is stopped by
   Paul. Paul did not foresee Gurney's attack and concludes he must
   increase his prescience by drinking the Water of Life, which is fatal
   to males. Paul falls into unconsciousness for three weeks after
   drinking the poison, but when he wakes, he has clairvoyance across time
   and space: he is the Kwisatz Haderach, the ultimate goal of the Bene
   Gesserit breeding program.

   Paul senses the Emperor and the Baron are amassing fleets around
   Arrakis to quell the Fremen rebellion, and prepares the Fremen for a
   major offensive. The Emperor arrives with the Baron on Arrakis. The
   Sardaukar seize a Fremen outpost, killing many, including young Leto,
   while Alia is captured and taken to the Emperor. Under cover of an
   electric storm, which shorts out the Sardaukar's defensive shields,
   Paul and the Fremen, riding giant sandworms, destroy the capital's
   natural rock fortifications with atomics and attack, while Alia
   assassinates the Baron and escapes. The Fremen quickly defeat both the
   Harkonnen and Sardaukar troops, killing Rabban in the process. Thufir
   is ordered to assassinate Paul, who gives him the opportunity to take
   anything that Thufir wishes of him. Thufir chooses to stab himself with
   the poisoned needle intended for Paul.

   Paul faces the Emperor, threatening to destroy spice production forever
   unless Shaddam abdicates the throne. Feyd-Rautha challenges Paul to a
   knife fight, during which he cheats and tries to kill Paul with a
   poison spur in his belt. Paul gains the upper hand and kills him. The
   Emperor reluctantly cedes the throne to Paul and promises his daughter
   Princess Irulan's hand in marriage. Paul takes control of the Empire,
   but realizes that he cannot stop the Fremen jihad, as their belief in
   him is too powerful to restrain.

Themes and influences

   [edit]

   The Dune series is a landmark of science fiction. Herbert deliberately
   suppressed technology in his Dune universe so he could address the
   politics of humanity, rather than the future of humanity's technology.
   For example, a key pre-history event to the novel's present is the
   "Butlerian Jihad", in which all robots and computers were destroyed,
   eliminating these common elements to science fiction from the novel as
   to allow focus on humanity.^[15] Dune considers the way humans and
   their institutions might change over time.^[1] Director John Harrison,
   who adapted Dune for Syfy's 2000 miniseries, called the novel a
   universal and timeless reflection of "the human condition and its moral
   dilemmas", and said:

     A lot of people refer to Dune as science fiction. I never do. I
     consider it an epic adventure in the classic storytelling tradition,
     a story of myth and legend not unlike the Morte d'Arthur or any
     messiah story. It just happens to be set in the future ... The story
     is actually more relevant today than when Herbert wrote it. In the
     1960s, there were just these two colossal superpowers duking it out.
     Today we're living in a more feudal, corporatized world more akin to
     Herbert's universe of separate families, power centers and business
     interests, all interrelated and kept together by the one commodity
     necessary to all.^[18]

   But Dune has also been called a mix of soft and hard science fiction
   since "the attention to ecology is hard, the anthropology and the
   psychic abilities are soft."^[19] Hard elements include the ecology of
   Arrakis, suspensor technology, weapon systems, and ornithopters, while
   soft elements include issues relating to religion, physical and mental
   training, cultures, politics, and psychology.^[20]

   Herbert said Paul's messiah figure was inspired by the Arthurian
   legend,^[21] and that the scarcity of water on Arrakis was a metaphor
   for oil, as well as air and water itself, and for the shortages of
   resources caused by overpopulation.^[22] Novelist Brian Herbert, his
   son and biographer, wrote:

     Dune is a modern-day conglomeration of familiar myths, a tale in
     which great sandworms guard a precious treasure of melange, the
     geriatric spice that represents, among other things, the finite
     resource of oil. The planet Arrakis features immense, ferocious
     worms that are like dragons of lore, with "great teeth" and a
     "bellows breath of cinnamon." This resembles the myth described by
     an unknown English poet in Beowulf, the compelling tale of a
     fearsome fire dragon who guarded a great treasure hoard in a lair
     under cliffs, at the edge of the sea. The desert of Frank Herbert's
     classic novel is a vast ocean of sand, with giant worms diving into
     the depths, the mysterious and unrevealed domain of Shai-hulud. Dune
     tops are like the crests of waves, and there are powerful sandstorms
     out there, creating extreme danger. On Arrakis, life is said to
     emanate from the Maker (Shai-hulud) in the desert-sea; similarly all
     life on Earth is believed to have evolved from our oceans. Frank
     Herbert drew parallels, used spectacular metaphors, and extrapolated
     present conditions into world systems that seem entirely alien at
     first blush. But close examination reveals they aren't so different
     from systems we know ... and the book characters of his imagination
     are not so different from people familiar to us.^[23]

   Each chapter of Dune begins with an epigraph excerpted from the
   fictional writings of the character Princess Irulan. In forms such as
   diary entries, historical commentary, biography, quotations and
   philosophy, these writings set tone and provide exposition, context and
   other details intended to enhance understanding of Herbert's complex
   fictional universe and themes.^[24]^[25]^[26] They act as foreshadowing
   and invite the reader to keep reading to close the gap between what the
   epigraph says and what is happening in the main narrative.^[27] The
   epigraphs also give the reader the feeling that the world they are
   reading about is epically distanced, since Irulan writes about an
   idealized image of Paul as if he had already passed into memory.^[28]
   Brian Herbert wrote: "Dad told me that you could follow any of the
   novel's layers as you read it, and then start the book all over again,
   focusing on an entirely different layer. At the end of the book, he
   intentionally left loose ends and said he did this to send the readers
   spinning out of the story with bits and pieces of it still clinging to
   them, so that they would want to go back and read it again."^[29]

Middle-Eastern and Islamic references

   [edit]

   Due to the similarities between some of Herbert's terms and ideas and
   actual words and concepts in the Arabic language, as well as the
   series' "Islamic undertones" and themes, a Middle-Eastern influence on
   Herbert's works has been noted repeatedly.^[30]^[31] In his
   descriptions of the Fremen culture and language, Herbert uses both
   authentic Arabic words and Arabic-sounding words.^[32]^[33] For
   example, one of the names for the sandworm, Shai-hulud, is derived from
   شيء خلود, šayʾ ḫulūd, 'immortal thing' or شيخ خلود, šayḫ ḫulūd, 'old
   man of eternity'.^[33]^[34] The title of the Fremen housekeeper, the
   Shadout Mapes, is borrowed from the شادوف, šādūf, the Egyptian term for
   a device used to raise water.^[33] In particular, words related to the
   messianic religion of the Fremen, first implanted by the Bene Gesserit,
   are taken from Arabic, including Muad'Dib (from مؤدب, muʾaddib,
   'educator'), Lisan al-Gaib (from لسان الغيب, lisān al-ġayb, 'voice of
   the unseen'), Usul (from أصول, ʾuṣūl, 'fundamental principles'),
   Shari-a (from شريعة, šarīʿa, 'sharia; path'), Shaitan (from شيطان,
   šayṭān, 'Shaitan; devil; fiend'), and jinn (from جن, ǧinn, 'jinn;
   spirit; demon; mythical being').^[30] It is likely Herbert relied on
   second-hand resources such as phrasebooks and desert adventure stories
   to find these Arabic words and phrases for the Fremen.^[33] They are
   meaningful and carefully chosen, and help create an "imagined desert
   culture that resonates with exotic sounds, enigmas, and pseudo-Islamic
   references" and has a distinctly Bedouin aesthetic.^[33]

   As a foreigner who adopts the ways of a desert-dwelling people and then
   leads them in a military capacity, Paul Atreides bears many
   similarities to the historical T. E. Lawrence.^[35] His 1962 biopic
   Lawrence of Arabia has also been identified as a potential
   influence.^[36]^[better source needed] The Sabres of Paradise (1960)
   has also been identified as a potential influence upon Dune, with its
   depiction of Imam Shamil and the Islamic culture of the Caucasus
   inspiring some of the themes, characters, events and terminology of
   Dune.^[9]

   The environment of the desert planet Arrakis was primarily inspired by
   the environments of the Middle East. Similarly Arrakis as a bioregion
   is presented as a particular kind of political site. Herbert has made
   it resemble a desertified petrostate area.^[37] The Fremen people of
   Arrakis were influenced by the Bedouin tribes of Arabia, and the Mahdi
   prophecy originates from Islamic eschatology.^[38] Inspiration is also
   adopted from medieval historian Ibn Khaldun's cyclical history and his
   dynastic concept in North Africa, hinted at by Herbert's reference to
   Khaldun's book Kitāb al-ʿibar ("The Book of Lessons"). The
   fictionalized version of the "Kitab al-ibar" in Dune is a combination
   of a Fremen religious manual and a desert survival book.^[39]^[40]

Additional language and historic influences

   [edit]

   In addition to Arabic, Dune derives words and names from a variety of
   other languages, including Navajo, Latin, Old Scandinavian
   ("Landsraad"),^[41] Romani, Hebrew ("Kefitzat haderech", קפיצת הדרך,
   contracting of the path), Serbo-Croatian, Nahuatl, Greek, Persian,
   Sanskrit ("prana bindu", "prajna"), Russian, Turkish, Finnish, and Old
   English.^[42]^[43] Bene Gesserit is part of the Latin legal phrase
   quamdiu se bene gesserit "as long as he shall behave himself well" seen
   in grants of certain offices (such as judgeships) meaning that the
   appointee shall remain in office so long as he shall not be guilty of
   abusing it. Some critics miss the connotation of the phrase, misled by
   the Latin future perfect gesserit, taking it over-literally (and adding
   an unwarranted passive) to mean "it will have been well borne", an
   interpretation which is not well supported by the Bene Gesserit
   doctrine in the story.^[44]^[original research?]

   Through the inspiration from The Sabres of Paradise, there are also
   allusions to the tsarist-era Russian nobility and Cossacks.^[45] Frank
   Herbert stated that bureaucracy that lasted long enough would become a
   hereditary nobility, and a significant theme behind the aristocratic
   families in Dune was "aristocratic bureaucracy" which he saw as
   analogous to the Soviet Union.^[46]^[47]

Environmentalism and ecology

   [edit]

   Dune has been called the "first planetary ecology novel on a grand
   scale".^[48] Herbert hoped it would be seen as an "environmental
   awareness handbook" and said the title was meant to "echo the sound of
   'doom'".^[49] It was reviewed in the best-selling countercultural Whole
   Earth Catalog in 1968 as a "rich re-readable fantasy with clear
   portrayal of the fierce environment it takes to cohere a
   community".^[50]

   After the publication of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson in 1962,
   science fiction writers began treating the subject of ecological change
   and its consequences. Dune responded in 1965 with its complex
   descriptions of Arrakis life, from giant sandworms (for whom water is
   deadly) to smaller, mouse-like life-forms adapted to live with limited
   water. Dune was followed in its creation of complex and unique
   ecologies by other science fiction books such as A Door into Ocean
   (1986) and Red Mars (1992).^[48] Environmentalists have pointed out
   that Dune's popularity as a novel depicting a planet as a
   complex—almost living—thing, in combination with the first images of
   Earth from space being published in the same time period, strongly
   influenced environmental movements such as the establishment of the
   international Earth Day.^[51]

   While the genre of climate fiction was popularized in the 2010s in
   response to real global climate change, Dune as well as other early
   science fiction works from authors like J. G. Ballard (The Drowned
   World) and Kim Stanley Robinson (the Mars trilogy) have retroactively
   been considered pioneering examples of the genre.^[52]^[53]

Declining empires

   [edit]

   The Imperium in Dune contains features of various empires in Europe and
   the Near East, including the Roman Empire, Holy Roman Empire, and
   Ottoman Empire.^[34]^[54]^[55] Lorenzo DiTommaso compared Dune's
   portrayal of the downfall of a galactic empire to Edward Gibbon's
   Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, which argues that Christianity
   allied with the profligacy of the Roman elite led to the fall of
   Ancient Rome. In "The Articulation of Imperial Decadence and Decline in
   Epic Science Fiction" (2007), DiTommaso outlines similarities between
   the two works by highlighting the excesses of the Emperor on his home
   planet of Kaitain and of the Baron Harkonnen in his palace. The Emperor
   loses his effectiveness as a ruler through an excess of ceremony and
   pomp. The hairdressers and attendants he brings with him to Arrakis are
   even referred to as "parasites". The Baron Harkonnen is similarly
   corrupt and materially indulgent. Gibbon's Decline and Fall partly
   blames the fall of Rome on the rise of Christianity. Gibbon claimed
   that this exotic import from a conquered province weakened the soldiers
   of Rome and left it open to attack. The Emperor's Sardaukar fighters
   are little match for the Fremen of Dune not only because of the
   Sardaukar's overconfidence and the fact that Jessica and Paul have
   trained the Fremen in their battle tactics, but because of the Fremen's
   capacity for self-sacrifice. The Fremen put the community before
   themselves in every instance, while the world outside wallows in luxury
   at the expense of others.^[56]

   The decline and long peace of the Empire sets the stage for revolution
   and renewal by genetic mixing of successful and unsuccessful groups
   through war, a process culminating in the Jihad led by Paul Atreides,
   described by Frank Herbert as depicting "war as a collective orgasm"
   (drawing on Norman Walter's 1950 The Sexual Cycle of Human
   Warfare),^[57]^[58] themes that would reappear in God Emperor of Dune's
   Scattering and Leto II's all-female Fish Speaker army.

Gender dynamics

   [edit]

   Gender dynamics are complex in Dune. Herbert offers a multi-layered
   portrayal of gender roles within the context of a feudal, hierarchical
   society, particularly through the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood. Although
   the Bene Gesserit tend to hold roles that are traditionally associated
   with women, such as wives, concubines, and mothers, their characters
   transcend stereotypes as they play politics and pursue long-term
   strategic goals. Full gender equality is not depicted in Dune, but the
   Bene Gesserit use specialized training and access to high-ranking men
   to gain agency and power within the constraints of their environment.
   Their training in prana-bindu allows them to exert control over their
   minds and bodies, including over pregnancy, and they are skilled in
   hand-to-hand combat and use of the Voice to command others. Jessica's
   disobedience in bearing a son instead of daughter and training him in
   the Bene Gesserit Way is a major plot point that sets in motion the
   events of the novel.^[59]^[60] By setting up certain women with leaders
   of certain Houses in the Imperium, the Bene Gesserit can control
   bloodlines across generations through their secret breeding
   program.^[61] Even within the male-dominated Imperium, then, the Bene
   Gesserit wield reproductive power and choose which genetic markers to
   continue into the future.^[62]

   Reverend Mother Mohiam uses skills in Truthsaying to act as the
   Emperor's official Truthsayer and advisor. Her role can be considered
   similar to that of abbesses in the medieval Church. Before Princess
   Irulan appears as a character who agrees to a political marriage with
   Paul, she acts as a historian who shapes the reader's interpretation of
   the story and Paul's legacy due to the excerpts from her writing that
   frame each chapter.^[59]^[60]

   Among the Fremen, women have roles as mothers and wives and also
   exercise agency through combat and religious authority. Fremen women
   and children have a reputation for being just as violent and dangerous
   as Fremen men. Chani travels with Stilgar in his military party, armed
   like the others. After becoming Paul's concubine, she kills one of the
   men who comes to challenge him. Alia leads an attack against the
   Emperor's Sardaukar and kills Baron Harkonnen with a gom jabbar. Women
   also take on the role of religious leaders. Chani is a Sayyadina who
   presides over tribal rituals such as Paul's worm-riding test, and
   Reverend Mother Ramallo carries the tribe's memories and passes them
   along to Jessica through the Water of Life ceremony. Within the
   male-led sietches, Fremen women find different avenues of
   authority.^[63]

   The gom jabbar test of humanity is administered by the female Bene
   Gesserit order but rarely to males.^[64] The Bene Gesserit have
   seemingly mastered the unconscious and can play on the unconscious
   weaknesses of others using the Voice, yet their breeding program seeks
   after a male Kwisatz Haderach.^[35] Their plan is to produce a male who
   can "possess complete racial memory, both male and female," and look
   into the black hole in the collective unconscious that they fear.^[65]
   A central theme of the book is the connection, in Jessica's son, of
   this female aspect with his male aspect. This aligns with concepts in
   Jungian psychology, which features conscious/unconscious and
   taking/giving roles associated with males and females, as well as the
   idea of the collective unconscious.^[66] Paul's approach to power
   consistently requires his upbringing under the matriarchal Bene
   Gesserit, who operate as a long-dominating shadow government behind all
   of the great houses and their marriages or divisions.^[65] He is
   trained by Jessica in the Bene Gesserit Way, which includes prana-bindu
   training in nerve and muscle control and precise perception.^[60] Paul
   also receives Mentat training, thus helping prepare him to be a type of
   androgynous Kwisatz Haderach, a male Reverend Mother.^[65]

   In a Bene Gesserit test early in the book, it is implied that people
   are generally "inhuman" in that they irrationally place desire over
   self-interest and reason.^[citation needed] This applies Herbert's
   philosophy that humans are not created equal, while equal justice and
   equal opportunity are higher ideals than mental, physical, or moral
   equality.^[67]

Heroism

   [edit]

     I am showing you the superhero syndrome and your own participation
     in it.

   — Frank Herbert^[68]

   Throughout Paul's rise to superhuman status, he follows a plotline
   common to many stories describing the birth of a hero.^[69] He has
   unfortunate circumstances forced onto him. After a long period of
   hardship and exile, he confronts and defeats the source of evil in his
   tale.^[70]^[71] As such, Dune is representative of a general trend
   beginning in 1960s American science fiction in that it features a
   character who attains godlike status through scientific means.^[72]
   Eventually, Paul Atreides gains a level of omniscience which allows him
   to take over the planet and the galaxy, and causes the Fremen of
   Arrakis to worship him like a god. Author Frank Herbert said in 1979,
   "The bottom line of the Dune trilogy is: beware of heroes. Much better
   to rely on your own judgment, and your own mistakes."^[73] He wrote in
   1985, "Dune was aimed at this whole idea of the infallible leader
   because my view of history says that mistakes made by a leader (or made
   in a leader's name) are amplified by the numbers who follow without
   question."^[74]

   Juan A. Prieto-Pablos says Herbert achieves a new typology with Paul's
   superpowers, differentiating the heroes of Dune from earlier heroes
   such as Superman, van Vogt's Gilbert Gosseyn and Henry Kuttner's
   telepaths. Unlike previous superheroes who acquire their powers
   suddenly and accidentally, Paul's are the result of "painful and slow
   personal progress." And unlike other superheroes of the 1960s—who are
   the exception among ordinary people in their respective
   worlds—Herbert's characters grow their powers through "the application
   of mystical philosophies and techniques." For Herbert, the ordinary
   person can develop incredible fighting skills (Fremen, Ginaz swordsmen
   and Sardaukar) or mental abilities (Bene Gesserit, Mentats, Spacing
   Guild Navigators).^[75]

Zen and religion

   [edit]
   Main article: List of Dune religions

   Early in his newspaper career, Herbert was introduced to Zen by two
   Jungian psychologists, Ralph and Irene Slattery, who "gave a crucial
   boost to his thinking".^[76] Zen teachings ultimately had "a profound
   and continuing influence on [Herbert's] work".^[76] Throughout the Dune
   series and particularly in Dune, Herbert employs concepts and forms
   borrowed from Zen Buddhism.^[76]^[77] The Fremen are referred to as
   Zensunni adherents, and many of Herbert's epigraphs are
   Zen-spirited.^[78] In "Dune Genesis", Frank Herbert wrote:

     What especially pleases me is to see the interwoven themes, the
     fugue like relationships of images that exactly replay the way Dune
     took shape. As in an Escher lithograph, I involved myself with
     recurrent themes that turn into paradox. The central paradox
     concerns the human vision of time. What about Paul's gift of
     prescience—the Presbyterian fixation? For the Delphic Oracle to
     perform, it must tangle itself in a web of predestination. Yet
     predestination negates surprises and, in fact, sets up a
     mathematically enclosed universe whose limits are always
     inconsistent, always encountering the unprovable. It's like a koan,
     a Zen mind breaker. It's like the Cretan Epimenides saying, "All
     Cretans are liars."^[67]

   Brian Herbert called the Dune universe "a spiritual melting pot",
   noting that his father incorporated elements of a variety of religions,
   including Buddhism, Sufi mysticism and other Islamic belief systems,
   Catholicism, Protestantism, Judaism, and Hinduism.^[79] He added that
   Frank Herbert's fictional future in which "religious beliefs have
   combined into interesting forms" represents the author's solution to
   eliminating arguments between religions, each of which claimed to have
   "the one and only revelation."^[79]^[80]

Asimov's Foundation

   [edit]

   Tim O'Reilly suggests that Herbert also wrote Dune as a counterpoint to
   Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. In his monograph on Frank Herbert,
   O'Reilly wrote that "Dune is clearly a commentary on the Foundation
   trilogy. Herbert has taken a look at the same imaginative situation
   that provoked Asimov's classic—the decay of a galactic empire—and
   restated it in a way that draws on different assumptions and suggests
   radically different conclusions. The twist he has introduced into Dune
   is that the Mule, not the Foundation, is his hero."^[81] According to
   O'Reilly, Herbert bases the Bene Gesserit on the scientific shamans of
   the Foundation, though they use biological rather than statistical
   science.^[81] In contrast to the Foundation series and its praise of
   science and rationality, Dune proposes that the unconscious and
   unexpected are actually what are needed for humanity.^[81]

   Both Herbert and Asimov explore the implications of prescience (i.e.,
   visions of the future) both psychologically and socially. The
   Foundation series deploys a broadly determinist approach to prescient
   vision rooted in mathematical reasoning on a macroscopic social level.
   Dune, by contrast, invents a biologically rooted power of prescience
   that becomes determinist when the user actively relies on it to
   navigate past an undefined threshold of detail. Herbert's eugenically
   produced and spice-enhanced prescience is also personalized to
   individual actors whose roles in later books constrain each other's
   visions, rendering the future more or less mutable as time progresses.
   In what might be a comment on Foundation, Herbert's most powerfully
   prescient being in God Emperor of Dune laments the boredom engendered
   by prescience, and values surprises, especially regarding one's death,
   as a psychological necessity.^[citation needed]

   However, both works contain a similar theme of the restoration of
   civilization^[82] and seem to make the fundamental assumption that
   "political maneuvering, the need to control material resources, and
   friendship or mating bonds will be fundamentally the same in the future
   as they are now."^[83]

Critical reception

   [edit]

   Dune tied with Roger Zelazny's This Immortal for the Hugo Award in
   1966^[84] and won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel.^[85]
   Reviews of the novel have been largely positive, and Dune is considered
   by some critics to be the best science fiction book ever written.^[86]
   The novel has been translated into dozens of languages, and has sold
   almost 20 million copies.^[87] Dune has been regularly cited as one of
   the world's best-selling science fiction novels.^[4]^[88]

   Arthur C. Clarke described Dune as "unique" and wrote, "I know nothing
   comparable to it except The Lord of the Rings."^[89] Robert A. Heinlein
   described the novel as "powerful, convincing, and most
   ingenious."^[89]^[90] It was described as "one of the monuments of
   modern science fiction" by the Chicago Tribune,^[89] and P. Schuyler
   Miller called Dune "one of the landmarks of modern science fiction ...
   an amazing feat of creation."^[90] The Washington Post described it as
   "a portrayal of an alien society more complete and deeply detailed than
   any other author in the field has managed ... a story absorbing equally
   for its action and philosophical vistas ... An astonishing science
   fiction phenomenon."^[89]^[90] Algis Budrys praised Dune for the
   vividness of its imagined setting, saying "The time lives. It breathes,
   it speaks, and Herbert has smelt it in his nostrils". He found that the
   novel, however, "turns flat and tails off at the end. ... [T]ruly
   effective villains simply simper and melt; fierce men and cunning
   statesmen and seeresses all bend before this new Messiah". Budrys
   faulted in particular Herbert's decision to kill Paul's infant son
   offstage, with no apparent emotional impact, saying "you cannot be so
   busy saving a world that you cannot hear an infant shriek".^[91] After
   criticizing unrealistic science fiction, Carl Sagan in 1978 listed Dune
   as among stories "that are so tautly constructed, so rich in the
   accommodating details of an unfamiliar society that they sweep me along
   before I have even a chance to be critical".^[92]

   The Louisville Times wrote, "Herbert's creation of this universe, with
   its intricate development and analysis of ecology, religion, politics,
   and philosophy, remains one of the supreme and seminal achievements in
   science fiction."^[90] Writing for The New Yorker, Jon Michaud praised
   Herbert's "clever authorial decision" to exclude robots and computers
   ("two staples of the genre") from his fictional universe, but suggested
   that this may be one explanation why Dune lacks "true fandom among
   science-fiction fans" to the extent that it "has not penetrated popular
   culture in the way that The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars have".^[15]
   Tamara I. Hladik wrote that the story "crafts a universe where lesser
   novels promulgate excuses for sequels. All its rich elements are in
   balance and plausible—not the patchwork confederacy of made-up
   languages, contrived customs, and meaningless histories that are the
   hallmark of so many other, lesser novels."^[93]

   On November 5, 2019, the BBC News listed Dune on its list of the 100
   most inspiring novels.^[94]

   J. R. R. Tolkien refused to review Dune, on the grounds that he
   disliked it "with some intensity" and thus felt it would be unfair to
   Herbert, another working author, if he gave an honest review of the
   book.^[95]

First edition prints and manuscripts

   [edit]

   The first edition of Dune is one of the most valuable in science
   fiction book collecting. Copies have been sold for more than $20,000 at
   auction.^[96]

   California State University, Fullerton's Pollak Library has several of
   Herbert's draft manuscripts of Dune and other works, with the author's
   notes, in their Frank Herbert Archives.^[97]

Sequels and prequels

   [edit]
   See also: Dune (franchise) § Development and publication

   After Dune proved to be a critical and financial success for Herbert,
   he was able to devote himself full time to writing additional novels in
   the series. He had already drafted parts of the second and third while
   writing Dune.^[15] The series included Dune Messiah (1969), Children of
   Dune (1976), God Emperor of Dune (1981), Heretics of Dune (1984), and
   Chapterhouse: Dune (1985), each sequentially continuing on the
   narrative from Dune. Herbert died on February 11, 1986.^[98]

   Herbert's son, Brian Herbert, had found several thousand pages of notes
   left by his father that outlined ideas for other narratives related to
   Dune. Brian Herbert enlisted author Kevin J. Anderson to help build out
   prequel novels to the events of Dune. Brian Herbert's and Anderson's
   Dune prequels first started publication in 1999, and have led to
   additional stories that take place between those of Frank Herbert's
   books.^[99] The notes for what would have been Dune 7 also enabled them
   to publish Hunters of Dune (2006) and Sandworms of Dune (2007), sequels
   to Frank Herbert's final novel Chapterhouse: Dune, which complete the
   chronological progression of his original series, and wrap up
   storylines that began in Heretics of Dune.

Adaptations

   [edit]

   Further information: Dune (franchise) § In other media

   Dune has been considered an "unfilmable" and "uncontainable" work to
   adapt from novel to film or other visual medium.^[100] Described by
   Wired, "It has four appendices and a glossary of its own gibberish, and
   its action takes place on two planets, one of which is a desert overrun
   by worms the size of airport runways. Lots of important people die or
   try to kill each other, and they're all tethered to about eight
   entangled subplots."^[101] There have been several attempts to achieve
   this difficult conversion with various degrees of success.^[102]

Early stalled attempts

   [edit]

   In 1971, the production company Apjac International (APJ) (headed by
   Arthur P. Jacobs) optioned the rights to film Dune. As Jacobs was busy
   with other projects, such as the sequel to Planet of the Apes, Dune was
   delayed for another year. Jacobs' first choice for director was David
   Lean, but he turned down the offer. Charles Jarrott was also considered
   to direct. Work was also under way on a script while the hunt for a
   director continued. Initially, the first treatment had been handled by
   Robert Greenhut, the producer who had lobbied Jacobs to make the movie
   in the first place, but subsequently Rospo Pallenberg was approached to
   write the script, with shooting scheduled to begin in 1974. However,
   Jacobs died in 1973.^[103]
   [330px-Jodorowskys_Dune.jpg] Pre-release flyer for Jodorowsky's Dune

   In December 1974, a French consortium led by Jean-Paul Gibon purchased
   the film rights from APJ, with Alejandro Jodorowsky set to
   direct.^[104] In 1975, Jodorowsky planned to film the story as a 3-hour
   feature, set to star his own son Brontis Jodorowsky in the lead role of
   Paul Atreides, Salvador Dalí as Shaddam IV, Padishah Emperor, Amanda
   Lear as Princess Irulan, Orson Welles as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen,
   Gloria Swanson as Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, David Carradine
   as Duke Leto Atreides, Geraldine Chaplin as Lady Jessica, Alain Delon
   as Duncan Idaho, Hervé Villechaize as Gurney Halleck, Udo Kier as Piter
   De Vries, and Mick Jagger as Feyd-Rautha. It was at first proposed to
   score the film with original music by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Henry Cow,
   and Magma; later on, the soundtrack was to be provided by Pink
   Floyd.^[105] Jodorowsky set up a pre-production unit in Paris
   consisting of Chris Foss, a British artist who designed covers for
   science fiction periodicals, Jean Giraud (Moebius), a French
   illustrator who created and also wrote and drew for Metal Hurlant
   magazine, and H. R. Giger.^[104] Moebius began designing creatures and
   characters for the film, while Foss was brought in to design the film's
   space ships and hardware.^[104] Giger began designing the Harkonnen
   Castle based on Moebius's storyboards. Dan O'Bannon was to head the
   special effects department.^[104]

   Dalí was cast as the Emperor.^[104] Dalí later demanded to be paid
   $100,000 per hour; Jodorowsky agreed, but tailored Dalí's part to be
   filmed in one hour, drafting plans for other scenes of the emperor to
   use a mechanical mannequin as substitute for Dalí.^[104] According to
   Giger, Dalí was "later invited to leave the film because of his
   pro-Franco statements".^[106] Just as the storyboards, designs, and
   script were finished, the financial backing dried up. Frank Herbert
   traveled to Europe in 1976 to find that $2 million of the $9.5 million
   budget had already been spent in pre-production, and that Jodorowsky's
   script would result in a 14-hour movie ("It was the size of a phone
   book", Herbert later recalled). Jodorowsky took creative liberties with
   the source material, but Herbert said that he and Jodorowsky had an
   amicable relationship. Jodorowsky said in 1985 that he found the Dune
   story mythical and had intended to re-create it rather than adapt the
   novel; though he had an "enthusiastic admiration" for Herbert,
   Jodorowsky said he had done everything possible to distance the author
   and his input from the project.^[104] Although Jodorowsky was
   embittered by the experience, he said the Dune project changed his
   life, and some of the ideas were used in his and Moebius's The
   Incal.^[107] O'Bannon entered a psychiatric hospital after the
   production failed, then worked on 13 scripts, the last of which became
   Alien.^[104] A 2013 documentary, Jodorowsky's Dune, was made about
   Jodorowsky's failed attempt at an adaptation.

   In 1976, Dino De Laurentiis acquired the rights from Gibon's
   consortium. De Laurentiis commissioned Herbert to write a new
   screenplay in 1978; the script Herbert turned in was 175 pages long,
   the equivalent of nearly three hours of screen time. De Laurentiis then
   hired director Ridley Scott in 1979, with Rudy Wurlitzer writing the
   screenplay and H. R. Giger retained from the Jodorowsky production;
   Scott and Giger had also just worked together on the film Alien, after
   O'Bannon recommended the artist.^[108]^[109] Scott intended to split
   the novel into two movies. He worked on three drafts of the script,
   using The Battle of Algiers as a point of reference, before moving on
   to direct another science fiction film, Blade Runner (1982). As he
   recalls, the pre-production process was slow, and finishing the project
   would have been even more time-intensive:

     But after seven months I dropped out of Dune, by then Rudy Wurlitzer
     had come up with a first-draft script which I felt was a decent
     distillation of Frank Herbert's. But I also realised Dune was going
     to take a lot more work—at least two and a half years' worth. And I
     didn't have the heart to attack that because my older brother Frank
     unexpectedly died of cancer while I was prepping the De Laurentiis
     picture. Frankly, that freaked me out. So I went to Dino and told
     him the Dune script was his.

          —From Ridley Scott: The Making of his Movies by Paul M. Sammon

   A draft of the screenplay for the Scott version was discovered in 2024
   in the Wheaton College archives.^[110]

1984 film by David Lynch

   [edit]

   Main article: Dune (1984 film)

   In 1981, the nine-year film rights were set to expire. De Laurentiis
   re-negotiated the rights from the author, adding to them the rights to
   the Dune sequels (written and unwritten). After seeing The Elephant
   Man, De Laurentiis' daughter Raffaella decided that David Lynch should
   direct the movie. Around that time Lynch received several other
   directing offers, including Return of the Jedi. He agreed to direct
   Dune and write the screenplay even though he had not read the book, was
   not familiar with the story, or even been interested in science
   fiction.^[111] Lynch worked on the script for six months with Eric
   Bergren and Christopher De Vore. The team yielded two drafts of the
   script before it split over creative differences. Lynch would
   subsequently work on five more drafts. Production of the work was
   troubled by problems at the Mexican studio and hampering the film's
   timeline.^[112] Lynch ended up producing a nearly three-hour-long film,
   but at demands from Universal Pictures, the film's distributor, he cut
   it back to about two hours, hastily filming additional scenes to make
   up for some of the cut footage.^[113]

   This first film of Dune, directed by Lynch, was released in 1984,
   nearly 20 years after the book's publication. Though Herbert said the
   book's depth and symbolism seemed to intimidate many filmmakers, he was
   pleased with the film, saying that "They've got it. It begins as Dune
   does. And I hear my dialogue all the way through. There are some
   interpretations and liberties, but you're gonna come out knowing you've
   seen Dune."^[114] Reviews of the film were negative, saying that it was
   incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book, and that fans would
   be disappointed by the way it strayed from the book's
   plot.^[100]^[115]^[116]^[117]^[118] Upon release for television and
   other forms of home media, Universal opted to reintroduce much of the
   footage that Lynch had cut, creating an over-three-hour-long version
   with extensive monologue exposition. Lynch was extremely displeased
   with this move, and demanded that Universal replace his name on these
   cuts with the pseudonym "Alan Smithee", and has generally distanced
   himself from the film since.^[113]

2000 miniseries by John Harrison

   [edit]

   Main article: Frank Herbert's Dune

   In 2000, John Harrison adapted the novel into Frank Herbert's Dune, a
   miniseries that premiered on the Sci-Fi Channel.^[18] As of 2004, the
   miniseries was one of the three highest-rated programs broadcast on the
   Sci-Fi Channel.^[119]

Further film attempts

   [edit]

   In 2008, Paramount Pictures announced that they would produce a new
   film based on the book, with Peter Berg attached to direct.^[120]
   Producer Kevin Misher, who spent a year securing the rights from the
   Herbert estate, was to be joined by Richard Rubinstein and John
   Harrison (of both Sci-Fi Channel miniseries) as well as Sarah Aubrey
   and Mike Messina.^[120] The producers stated that they were going for a
   "faithful adaptation" of the novel and considered "its theme of finite
   ecological resources particularly timely".^[120] Science fiction author
   Kevin J. Anderson and Frank Herbert's son Brian Herbert, who had
   together written multiple Dune sequels and prequels since 1999, were
   attached to the project as technical advisors.^[121] In October 2009,
   Berg dropped out of the project, later saying that it "for a variety of
   reasons wasn't the right thing" for him.^[122] Subsequently, with a
   script draft by Joshua Zetumer, Paramount reportedly sought a new
   director who could do the film for under $175 million.^[123] In 2010,
   Pierre Morel was signed on to direct, with screenwriter Chase Palmer
   incorporating Morel's vision of the project into Zetumer's original
   draft.^[124]^[125] By November 2010, Morel left the project.^[126]
   Paramount finally dropped plans for a remake in March 2011.^[127]

Films by Denis Villeneuve

   [edit]

   Main articles: Dune (2021 film) and Dune: Part Two

   In November 2016, Legendary Entertainment acquired the film and TV
   rights for Dune.^[128]^[129] Variety reported in December 2016 that
   Denis Villeneuve was in negotiations to direct the project,^[130] which
   was confirmed in February 2017.^[131] In April 2017, Legendary
   announced that Eric Roth would write the screenplay.^[132] Villeneuve
   explained in March 2018 that his adaptation will be split into two
   films, with the first installment scheduled to begin production in
   2019.^[133] Casting includes Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides,^[134]
   Dave Bautista as Rabban, Stellan Skarsgård as Baron Harkonnen,^[135]

   film, which had its initial premiere on September 3, 2021, at the
   Venice Film Festival,^[146] and wide release in both theaters and
   streaming on HBO Max on October 21, 2021, as part of Warner Bros.'
   approach to handling the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the film
   industry.^[147]^[148] The film received "generally favorable reviews"
   on Metacritic.^[149] It has gone on to win multiple awards and was
   named by the National Board of Review as one of the 10 best films of
   2021, as well as the American Film Institute in their annual top 10
   list.^[150] The film went on to be nominated for ten Academy Awards,
   winning six, the most wins of the night for any film in
   contention.^[151]

   A sequel, Dune: Part Two, was scheduled for release on November 3,
   2023,^[152] but was released on March 1, 2024, due to the 2023
   SAG-AFTRA strike.^[153] It had its world premiere at the Odeon Luxe
   Leicester Square, London, on February 15, 2024, and opened in the
   United States on March 1. It received critical acclaim especially for
   its visual effects and has grossed over $711 million worldwide, making
   it the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2024.

Audiobooks

   [edit]

   In 1993, Recorded Books Inc. released a 20-disc audiobook narrated by
   George Guidall. In 2007, Audio Renaissance released an audio book
   narrated by Simon Vance with some parts performed by Scott Brick,
   Orlagh Cassidy, Euan Morton, and other performers.

   Dune has been widely influential, inspiring numerous novels, music,
   films, television, games, and comic books.^[154] It is considered one
   of the most influential science fiction novels of all time, with
   numerous modern science fiction works owing their existence to
   Dune.^[citation needed] Dune has been referenced in numerous works of
   popular culture, including Star Wars, Star Trek, Chronicles of Riddick,
   The Kingkiller Chronicle and Futurama.^[155] Dune was cited as a source
   of inspiration for Hayao Miyazaki's anime film Nausicaä of the Valley
   of the Wind (1984) for its post-apocalyptic
   world.^[156]^[157]^[158]^[159]^[160]

   Dune was parodied in 1984's National Lampoon's Doon by Ellis Weiner,
   which William F. Touponce called "something of a tribute to Herbert's
   success on college campuses", noting that "the only other book to have
   been so honored is Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings," which was parodied
   by The Harvard Lampoon in 1969.^[161]

Music

   [edit]

     * In 1977, David Matthews became one of the first artists to dedicate
       an entire composition to Dune, publishing an album of the same name
       on CTI Records.^[162]
     * In 1978, French electronic musician Richard Pinhas released the
       nine-track Dune-inspired album Chronolyse, which includes the
       seven-part Variations sur le thème des Bene Gesserit.^[163]
     * In 1979, German electronic music pioneer Klaus Schulze released an
       LP titled Dune featuring motifs and lyrics inspired by the
       novel.^[164]
     * A similar musical project, Visions of Dune, was released also in
       1979 by Zed (a pseudonym of French electronic musician Bernard
       Sjazner).^[165]
     * 1981 French zeuhl band Dün released their album Eros which was

       form from their temporary name Dune.^[166]
     * Heavy metal band Iron Maiden wrote the song "To Tame a Land" based
       on the Dune story. It appears as the closing track to their 1983
       album Piece of Mind. The original working title of the song was
       "Dune"; however, the band was denied permission to use it, with
       Frank Herbert's agents stating "Frank Herbert doesn't like rock
       bands, particularly heavy rock bands, and especially bands like
       Iron Maiden".^[167]
     * Dune inspired the German happy hardcore band Dune, who have
       released several albums with space travel-themed songs.^[citation
       needed]
     * The progressive hardcore band Shai Hulud took their name from
       Dune.^[168]

     * "Traveller in Time", from the 1991 Blind Guardian album Tales from
       the Twilight World, is based mostly on Paul Atreides' visions of
       future and past.^[170]^[171]
     * The title of the 1993 Fear Factory album Fear is The Mindkiller is
       a quote from the "litany against fear".^[172]
     * The song "Near Fantastica", from the Matthew Good album Avalanche,
       makes reference to the "litany against fear", repeating "can't feel
       fear, fear's the mind killer" through a section of the song.^[173]
     * In the Fatboy Slim song "Weapon of Choice", the line "If you walk
       without rhythm/You won't attract the worm" is a near quotation from
       the sections of novel in which Stilgar teaches Paul to ride
       sandworms. Christopher Walken, who would later star in Dune: Part
       Two as Emperor Shaddam IV, appears in the music video.^[174]
     * Dune also inspired the 1999 album The 2nd Moon by the German death
       metal band Golem, which is a concept album about the series.^[175]
     * The song "The Eyes of Ibad" from Panchiko's 2000 EP

     * The debut album of Canadian musician Grimes, called Geidi Primes,
       is a concept album based on Dune.^[178]^[179]
     * In 2015, the Baltimore-based band Tendrills released a psych rock
       album called 10,191. The album's title, sound, emotionality, and
       some of its lyrics were inspired by the Dune novels.^[180]
     * Japanese singer Kenshi Yonezu, released a song titled "Dune", also
       known as "Sand Planet". The song was released on 2017, and it was
       created using the voice synthesizer Hatsune Miku for her 10th
       anniversary.^[181]
     * Sleep's 2018 album The Sciences features a song, Giza Butler, that
       references several aspects of Dune.^[182]

Games

   [edit]

   Further information: List of games based on Dune

   There have been a number of games based on the book, starting with the
   strategy–adventure game Dune (1992). The most important game adaptation
   is Dune II (1992), which established the conventions of modern
   real-time strategy games and is considered to be among the most
   influential video games of all time.^[185]

   The online game Lost Souls includes Dune-derived elements, including
   sandworms and melange—addiction to which can produce psychic
   talents.^[186] The 2016 game Enter the Gungeon features the spice
   melange as a random item which gives the player progressively stronger
   abilities and penalties with repeated uses, mirroring the long-term
   effects melange has on users.^[187]

   Rick Priestley cites Dune as a major influence on his 1987 wargame,
   Warhammer 40,000.^[188]

   In 2023, Funcom announced Dune: Awakening, an upcoming massively
   multiplayer online game set in the universe of Dune.^[189]^[190]^[191]

Space exploration

   [edit]

   The Apollo 15 astronauts named a small crater on Earth's Moon after the
   novel during the 1971 mission,^[192] and the name was formally adopted
   by the International Astronomical Union in 1973.^[193] Since 2009, the
   names of planets from the Dune novels have been adopted for the
   real-world nomenclature of plains and other features on Saturn's moon
   Titan, like Arrakis Planitia.^[194]^[195]^[196]
