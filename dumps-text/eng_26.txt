   Group of artifact types and structure layouts that often occur together

   An archaeological culture is a recurring assemblage of types of
   artifacts, buildings and monuments from a specific period and region
   that may constitute the material culture remains of a particular past
   human society. The connection between these types is an empirical
   observation. Their interpretation in terms of ethnic or political
   groups is based on archaeologists' understanding. However, this is
   often subject to long-unresolved debates. The concept of the
   archaeological culture is fundamental to culture-historical
   archaeology.

Concept

   [edit]

   Different cultural groups have material culture items that differ both
   functionally and aesthetically due to varying cultural and social
   practices. This notion is observably true on the broadest scales. For
   example, the equipment associated with the brewing of tea varies
   greatly across the world. Social relations to material culture often
   include notions of identity and status.^[citation needed]

   Advocates of culture-historical archaeology use the notion to argue
   that sets of material culture can be used to trace ancient groups of
   people that were either self-identifying societies or ethnic groups.
   Archaeological culture is a classifying device to order archaeological
   data, focused on artifacts as an expression of culture rather than
   people.^[1] The classic definition of this idea comes from Gordon
   Childe:^[2]

     We find certain types of remains – pots, implements, ornaments,
     burial rites and house forms – constantly recurring together. Such a
     complex of associated traits we shall call a "cultural group" or
     just a "culture". We assume that such a complex is the material
     expression of what today we would call "a people".

   — Childe 1929, pp. v–vi

   The concept of an archaeological culture was crucial to linking the
   typological analysis of archaeological evidence to mechanisms that
   attempted to explain why they change through time. The key explanations
   favoured by culture-historians were the diffusion of forms from one
   group to another or the migration of the peoples themselves. A
   simplistic example of the process might be that if one pottery-type had
   handles similar to those of a neighbouring type but decoration similar
   to a different neighbour, the idea for the two features might have
   diffused from the neighbours. Conversely, if one pottery-type suddenly
   replaces a great diversity of pottery types in an entire region, that
   might be interpreted as a new group migrating in with this new
   style.^[citation needed]

   This idea of culture is known as normative culture. It relies on the
   assumption found in the view of archaeological culture that artifacts
   found are "an expression of cultural norms," and that these norms
   define culture.^[2] This view is also required to be polythetic,
   multiple artifacts must be found for a site to be classified under a
   specific archaeological culture. One trait alone does not result in a
   culture, rather a combination of traits are required.^[2]

   This view culture gives life to the artifacts themselves. "Once
   'cultures' are regarded as things, it is possible to attribute behavior
   to them, and to talk about them as if they were living organisms."^[3]

   Archaeological cultures were equated separate 'peoples' (ethnic groups
   or races) leading in some cases to distinct nationalist
   archaeologies.^[citation needed]

   Most archaeological cultures are named after either the type artifact
   or type site that defines the culture. For example, cultures may be
   named after pottery types such as Linear Pottery culture or
   Funnelbeaker culture. More frequently, they are named after the site at
   which the culture was first defined such as the Hallstatt culture or
   Clovis culture.^[citation needed]

   Since the term "culture" has multiple different meanings, scholars have
   also coined a more specific term paleoculture, as a specific
   designation for prehistoric cultures.^[4] Critics argue that cultural
   taxonomies lack a strong consensus on the epistemological aims of
   cultural taxonomy,^[5]^[6]^[7]^[8]

Development

   [edit]

   The use of the term "culture" entered archaeology through 19th-century
   German ethnography, where the Kultur of tribal groups and rural
   peasants was distinguished from the Zivilisation of urbanised peoples.
   In contrast to the broader use of the word that was introduced to
   English-language anthropology by Edward Burnett Tylor, Kultur was used
   by German ethnologists to describe the distinctive ways of life of a
   particular people or Volk, in this sense equivalent to the French
   civilisation. Works of Kulturgeschichte (culture history) were produced
   by a number of German scholars, particularly Gustav Klemm, from 1780
   onwards, reflecting a growing interest in ethnicity in 19th-century
   Europe.^[9]

   The first use of "culture" in an archaeological context was in
   Christian Thomsen's 1836 work Ledetraad til Nordisk Oldkyndighed
   (Norwegian: Guide to Northern Antiquity). In the later half of the 19th
   century archaeologists in Scandinavia and central Europe increasingly
   made use of the German concept of culture to describe the different
   groups they distinguished in the archaeological record of particular
   sites and regions, often alongside and as a synonym of
   "civilisation".^[9] It was not until the 20th century and the works of
   German prehistorian and fervent nationalist Gustaf Kossinna that the
   idea of archaeological cultures became central to the discipline.
   Kossinna saw the archaeological record as a mosaic of clearly defined
   cultures (or Kultur-Gruppen, culture groups) that were strongly
   associated with race. He was particularly interested in reconstructing
   the movements of what he saw as the direct prehistoric ancestors of
   Germans, Slavs, Celts and other major Indo-European ethnic groups in
   order to trace the Aryan race to its homeland or Urheimat.^[10]

   The strongly racist character of Kossinna's work meant it had little
   direct influence outside of Germany at the time (the Nazi Party
   enthusiastically embraced his theories), or at all after World War II.
   However, the more general "culture history" approach to archaeology
   that he began did replace social evolutionism as the dominant paradigm
   for much of the 20th century. Kossinna's basic concept of the
   archaeological culture, stripped of its racial aspects, was adopted by
   Vere Gordon Childe and Franz Boas, at the time the most influential
   archaeologists in Britain and America respectively. Childe, in
   particular, was responsible for formulating the definition of
   archaeological culture that is still largely applies today. He defined
   archaeological culture as artifacts and remains that consistently occur
   together. This introduced a "new and discrete usage of the term which
   was significantly different from current anthropological usage." His
   definition in particular was purely a classifying device to order the
   archaeological data.^[1]

   Though he was sceptical about identifying particular ethnicities in the
   archaeological record and inclined much more to diffusionism than
   migrationism to explain culture change, Childe and later
   culture-historical archaeologists, like Kossinna, still equated
   separate archaeological cultures with separate "peoples".^[11] Later
   archaeologists^[who?] have questioned the straightforward relationship
   between material culture and human societies. The definition of
   archaeological cultures and their relationship to past people has
   become less clear; in some cases, what was believed to be a monolithic
   culture is shown by further study to be discrete societies. For
   example, the Windmill Hill culture now serves as a general label for
   several different groups that occupied southern Great Britain during
   the Neolithic.^[citation needed] Conversely, some archaeologists have
   argued that some supposedly distinctive cultures are manifestations of
   a wider culture, but they show local differences based on environmental
   factors such as those related to Clactonian man.^[citation needed]
   Conversely, archaeologists may make a distinction between material
   cultures that actually belonged to a single cultural group. It has been
   highlighted,^[who?] for example, that village-dwelling and nomadic
   Bedouin Arabs have radically different material cultures even if in
   other respects, they are similar. In the past, such synchronous
   findings were often interpreted as representing intrusion by other
   groups.^[citation needed]

Criticism

   [edit]

   The concept of archaeological cultures is itself a divisive subject
   within the archaeological field. When first developed, archaeologic
   culture was viewed as a reflection of actual human culture.^[1]

     ...in the traditional view we translate present into past by
     collecting artifacts into groups, and naming those groups as
     archaeological cultures. We then make the equation between an
     archaeological and a human culture by making the assumption that
     artifacts are the expressions of cultural ideas or norms. (...) This
     approach (...) was termed "culture history" by many (...).

   — Matthew Johnson, Archaeological Theory: An Introduction, p. 19–20

   This view of culture would be "entirely satisfactory if the aim of
   archaeology was solely the definition and description of these
   entities."^[12] However, as the 1960s rolled around and archaeology
   sought to be more scientific, archaeologists wanted to do more than
   just describe artifacts, and the archaeological culture found.^[2]

   Accusations came that archaeological culture was "idealist" as it
   assumes that norms and ideas are seen as being "important in the
   definition of cultural identity." It stresses the particularity of
   cultures: "Why and how they are different from the adjacent group."
   Processualists, and other subsequently critics of cultural-historical
   archaeology argued that archaeological culture treated culture as "just
   a rag-tag assemblage of ideas."^[13]

   Archaeological culture is presently useful for sorting and assembling
   artifacts, especially in European archaeology that often falls towards
   culture-historical archaeology.^[14]
