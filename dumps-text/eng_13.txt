   Organ culture is the cultivation of either whole organs or parts of
   organs in vitro.^[1] It is a development from tissue culture methods of
   research, as the use of the actual in vitro organ itself allows for
   more accurate modelling of the functions of an organ in various states
   and conditions.^[2]

   A key objective of organ culture is to maintain the architecture of the
   tissue and direct it towards normal development. In this technique, it
   is essential that the tissue is never disrupted or damaged. It thus
   requires careful handling. The media used for a growing organ culture
   are generally the same as those used for tissue culture. The techniques
   for organ culture can be classified into (i) those employing a solid
   medium and (ii) those employing liquid medium.

   Organ culture technology has contributed to advances in embryology,^[3]
   inflammation, cancer, and stem cell biology research.^[2]

Current progress

   [edit]

   In April 2006, scientists reported a successful trial of seven bladders
   grown in-vitro and given to humans.^[4]^[5] A bladder has been cultured
   by Anthony Atala of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine
   in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. A jawbone has been cultured at
   Columbia University, a lung has been cultured at Yale. A beating rat
   heart has been cultured by Doris Taylor at the University of Minnesota.
   An artificial kidney has been cultured by H. David Humes at the
   University of Michigan.^[6]

   Silk cut from silkworm cocoons has been successfully used as growth
   scaffolding for heart tissue production. Heart tissue does not
   regenerate if damaged, so producing replacement patches is of great
   interest. The experiment used rat heart cells and produced functional
   heart tissue. In order to further test applications to humans as a
   cure, a way to transform human stem cells into heart tissue would have
   to be found.^[7]

   In 2015, Harald Ott was able to grow a rat forelimb.^[8] He now works
   at Ott Lab which focuses on the creation of bioartificial hearts,
   lungs, tracheas and kidneys.^[9]

   In 2016, another test was done in which human cells were used to
   assemble intricately structured hearts. The hearts ultimately proved
   immature but proved we were yet one step further to making a heart from
   stem cells.^[10]^[11]

   In January 2017, scientists from Salk Institute for Biological Studies
   managed to create a pig embryo that had part of its DNA, critical for
   the growth of organs, edited out. They then introduced human stem cells
   inside the pig embryo to have the human DNA fill in the gaps.^[12]^[13]

   In March 2022, research was published that demonstrated the tentative
   success of a corneal implant called BPCDX that was shown to have
   significant tissue attachment and host cell migration once implanted.

Methodology

   [edit]

In vitro culture

   [edit]

   Embryonic organ culture is an easier alternative to normal organ
   culture derived from adult animals. The following are four techniques
   employed for embryonic organ culture.

Plasma clot method

   [edit]

   The following are general steps in organ culture on plasma clots.
    1. Prepare a plasma clot by mixing 15 drops of plasma with five drops
       of embryo extract in a watch glass.
    2. Place a watch glass on a pad of cotton wool in a petri dish; cotton
       wool is kept moist to prevent excessive evaporation from the dish.
    3. Place a small, carefully dissected piece of tissue on top of the
       plasma clots in watch glass.

   The technique has now been modified, and a raft of lens paper or rayon
   net is used on which the tissue is placed. Transfer of the tissue can
   then be achieved by raft easily. Excessive fluid is removed and the net
   with the tissue placed again on the fresh pool of medium.

Agar gel method

   [edit]

   Media solidified with agar are also used for organ culture and these
   media consist of 7 parts 1% agar in BSS, 3 parts chick embryo extract
   and 3 parts of horse serum. Defined media with or without serum are
   also used with agar. The medium with agar provides the mechanical
   support for organ culture. It does not liquefy. Embryonic organs
   generally grow well on agar, but adult organ culture will not survive
   on this medium.

   The culture of adult organs or parts from adult animals is more
   difficult due to their greater requirement of oxygen. A variety of
   adult organs (e.g. the liver) have been cultured using special media
   with special apparatus (Towell's II culture chamber). Since serum was
   found to be toxic, serum-free media were used, and the special
   apparatus permitted the use of 95% oxygen.

Raft Methods

   [edit]

   In this approach the explant is placed onto a raft of lens paper or
   rayon acetate, which is floated on serum in a watch glass. Rayon
   acetate rafts are made to float on the serum by treating their 4
   corners with silicone.

   Similarly, floatability of lens paper is enhanced by treating it with
   silicone. On each raft, 4 or more explants are usually placed.

   In a combination of raft and clot techniques, the explants are first
   placed on a suitable raft, which is then kept on a plasma clot. This
   modification makes media changes easy, and prevents the sinking of
   explants into liquefied plasma.

Grid Method

   [edit]

   Initially devised by Trowell in 1954, the grid method utilizes 25 mm x
   25 mm pieces of a suitable wire mesh or perforated stainless steel
   sheet whose edges are bent to form 4 legs of about 4 mm height.

   Skeletal tissues are generally placed directly on the grid but softer
   tissues like glands or skin are first placed on rafts, which are then
   kept on the grids.

   The grids themselves are placed in a culture chamber filled with fluid
   medium up to the grid; the chamber is supplied with a mixture of O[2]
   and CO[2] to meet the high O[2] requirements of adult mammalian organs.
   A modification of the original grid method is widely used to study the
   growth and differentiation of adult and embryonic tissues.

Uses

   [edit]

   Cultured organs can be an alternative for organs from other (living or
   deceased) people. This is useful as the availability of transplantable
   organs (derived from other people) is declining in developed countries.
   Another advantage is that cultured organs, created using the patients
   own stem cell, allows for organ transplants where the patient would no
   longer require immunosuppressive drugs.^[15]

Limitations

   [edit]
     * Results from in vitro organ cultures are often not comparable to
       those from in vivo studies (e.g. studies on drug action) since the
       drugs are metabolized in vivo but not in vitro.
