    3. The 4 Organizational Cultures

   [CorporateCulture.png]

The Organizational Cultures

   Over the years, we found out that every organization has a preferred
   way of operating across cultures, influenced by two main parameters,
   summarized in the following questions: Is the focus of what we do more
   on tasks or on people? Do we operate in a more egalitarian or
   hierarchical way? This enables us to define four categorical types of
   corporate culture. Each of these types of corporate culture is an
   “ideal type”: it cannot be found 100% in practice, but it shows the
   preference that one has and gives us guidance on how we think and
   learn, how we change, and how we motivate, reward, and resolve
   conflicts.

GUIDED MISSILE - Task Culture

   The Task Culture (Guided Missile) is egalitarian, impersonal and
   task-oriented. The focus is on tasks, typically undertaken by teams or
   project groups. Employees must do 'whatever it takes' to complete a
   task, and what is needed is often unclear and may have to be
   discovered. Everyone is at least potentially equal, since one’s
   relative contributions are not yet known.

EIFFEL TOWER - Role Culture

   The Role Culture (Eiffel Tower) is hierarchical and task-oriented.
   There is a bureaucratic division of labor with various roles and
   functions that is prescribed in advance. These are coordinated at the
   top by a hierarchy. You obey the boss because it is his or her role to
   instruct you. If each role is acted out as envisaged by the system then
   tasks will be completed as planned.

FAMILY - Power Culture

   The Power Culture (Family) is personal with close face-to-face
   relationships but also hierarchical, in the sense that the 'father' of
   a family has experience and authority greatly exceeding those of his
   'children'. This type of power is essentially intimate and benign. The
   work of the corporation in this type of culture is usually carried
   forward in an atmosphere that in many respects mimics the home.

INCUBATOR - Person Culture

   The Person Culture (Incubator) is personal and egalitarian. Indeed it
   has almost no structure at all and what structure it does provide is
   merely for personal convenience. The purpose of the organization is to
   free individuals from routine to more creative activities and to
   minimize time spent on self-maintenance.

What makes our approach on corporate culture unique

   The majority of organizations have a single dominant corporate culture
   that struggles with less dominant orientations, that can come either
   from national or from functional sub-cultures. There is NO "BEST"
   (SINGLE) corporate culture​ as there is is no significant correlation
   with any one single corporate culture and business performance, growth,
   sustainability or other similar output variables. On the contrary, our
   research found out that the highly performing cultures are the ones who
   can include in their DNA all the four types, by maximizing the value of
   the positive sides of each ones through reconciliation of competing
   demands like short and long term, push and pull etc…

   “The most effective corporate culture is the one that has the the push
   towards change of the Incubator, the commitment of the Family, the
   structure of the Tour Eiffel and the achievement drive of the Guided
   Missile”

How to get there?

   In every organization there are tensions.
   Diagnosing and dealing with these TENSIONS is, therefore, critical in
   cases of:​

   Mergers, acquisitions and alliances

   Increasing globalization - internationalization

   Creating a high performance organization​

   Moving to a values-driven organization​

   Change management​
