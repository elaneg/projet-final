   Process by which cells are grown under controlled conditions
   "Co-culture" redirects here. For the concept of
   cultures-within-cultures, see Subculture.

   Cell culture or tissue culture is the process by which cells are grown
   under controlled conditions, generally outside of their natural
   environment. After cells of interest have been isolated from living
   tissue, they can subsequently be maintained under carefully controlled
   conditions. They need to be kept at body temperature (37 °C) in an
   incubator.^[1] These conditions vary for each cell type, but generally
   consist of a suitable vessel with a substrate or rich medium that
   supplies the essential nutrients (amino acids, carbohydrates, vitamins,
   minerals), growth factors, hormones, and gases (CO[2], O[2]), and
   regulates the physio-chemical environment (pH buffer, osmotic pressure,
   temperature). Most cells require a surface or an artificial substrate
   to form an adherent culture as a monolayer (one single-cell thick),
   whereas others can be grown free floating in a medium as a suspension
   culture.^[2] This is typically facilitated via use of a liquid,
   semi-solid, or solid growth medium, such as broth or agar. Tissue
   culture commonly refers to the culture of animal cells and tissues,
   with the more specific term plant tissue culture being used for plants.
   The lifespan of most cells is genetically determined, but some
   cell-culturing cells have been 'transformed' into immortal cells which
   will reproduce indefinitely if the optimal conditions are provided.

   In practice, the term "cell culture" now refers to the culturing of
   cells derived from multicellular eukaryotes, especially animal cells,
   in contrast with other types of culture that also grow cells, such as
   plant tissue culture, fungal culture, and microbiological culture (of
   microbes). The historical development and methods of cell culture are
   closely interrelated with those of tissue culture and organ culture.
   Viral culture is also related, with cells as hosts for the viruses.

   The laboratory technique of maintaining live cell lines (a population
   of cells descended from a single cell and containing the same genetic
   makeup) separated from their original tissue source became more robust
   in the middle 20th century.^[3]^[4]

History

   [edit]

   The 19th-century English physiologist Sydney Ringer developed salt
   solutions containing the chlorides of sodium, potassium, calcium and
   magnesium suitable for maintaining the beating of an isolated animal
   heart outside the body.^[5] In 1885 Wilhelm Roux removed a section of
   the medullary plate of an embryonic chicken and maintained it in a warm
   saline solution for several days, establishing the basic principle of
   tissue culture. In 1907 the zoologist Ross Granville Harrison
   demonstrated the growth of frog embryonic cells that would give rise to
   nerve cells in a medium of clotted lymph. In 1913, E. Steinhardt, C.
   Israeli, and R. A. Lambert grew vaccinia virus in fragments of guinea
   pig corneal tissue.^[6] In 1996, the first use of regenerative tissue
   was used to replace a small length of urethra, which led to the
   understanding that the technique of obtaining samples of tissue,
   growing it outside the body without a scaffold, and reapplying it, can
   be used for only small distances of less than 1 cm.^[7]^[8]^[9] Ross
   Granville Harrison, working at Johns Hopkins Medical School and then at
   Yale University, published results of his experiments from 1907 to
   1910, establishing the methodology of tissue culture.^[10]

   Gottlieb Haberlandt first pointed out the possibilities of the culture
   of isolated tissues, plant tissue culture.^[11] He suggested that the
   potentialities of individual cells via tissue culture as well as that
   the reciprocal influences of tissues on one another could be determined
   by this method. Since Haberlandt's original assertions, methods for
   tissue and cell culture have been realized, leading to significant
   discoveries in biology and medicine. He presented his original idea of
   totipotentiality in 1902, stating that "Theoretically all plant cells
   are able to give rise to a complete plant."^[12]^[13]^[14] The term
   tissue culture was coined by American pathologist Montrose Thomas
   Burrows.^[15]

   Cell culture techniques were advanced significantly in the 1940s and
   1950s to support research in virology. Growing viruses in cell cultures
   allowed preparation of purified viruses for the manufacture of
   vaccines. The injectable polio vaccine developed by Jonas Salk was one
   of the first products mass-produced using cell culture techniques. This
   vaccine was made possible by the cell culture research of John Franklin
   Enders, Thomas Huckle Weller, and Frederick Chapman Robbins, who were
   awarded a Nobel Prize for their discovery of a method of growing the
   virus in monkey kidney cell cultures. Cell culture has contributed to
   the development of vaccines for many diseases.^[1]

Modern usage

   [edit]
   [250px-Cho_cells_adherend2.jpg] Cultured cells growing in growth medium

   In modern usage, "tissue culture" generally refers to the growth of
   cells from a tissue from a multicellular organism in vitro. These cells
   may be cells isolated from a donor organism (primary cells) or an
   immortalised cell line. The cells are bathed in a culture medium, which
   contains essential nutrients and energy sources necessary for the
   cells' survival.^[16] Thus, in its broader sense, "tissue culture" is
   often used interchangeably with "cell culture". On the other hand, the
   strict meaning of "tissue culture" refers to the culturing of tissue
   pieces, i.e. explant culture.

   Tissue culture is an important tool for the study of the biology of
   cells from multicellular organisms. It provides an in vitro model of
   the tissue in a well defined environment which can be easily
   manipulated and analysed. In animal tissue culture, cells may be grown
   as two-dimensional monolayers (conventional culture) or within fibrous
   scaffolds or gels to attain more naturalistic three-dimensional
   tissue-like structures (3D culture). A 1988 NIH SBIR grant report
   showed that electrospinning could be used to produce nano- and
   submicron-scale polymeric fibrous scaffolds specifically intended for
   use as in vitro cell and tissue substrates. This early use of
   electrospun fibrous lattices for cell culture and tissue engineering
   showed that various cell types would adhere to and proliferate upon
   polycarbonate fibers. It was noted that as opposed to the flattened
   morphology typically seen in 2D culture, cells grown on the electrospun
   fibers exhibited a more rounded 3-dimensional morphology generally
   observed of tissues in vivo.^[17]

   Plant tissue culture in particular is concerned with the growing of
   entire plants from small pieces of plant tissue, cultured in
   medium.^[18]

Concepts in mammalian cell culture

   [edit]

Isolation of cells

   [edit]
   Main article: Cell isolation

   Cells can be isolated from tissues for ex vivo culture in several ways.
   Cells can be easily purified from blood; however, only the white cells
   are capable of growth in culture. Cells can be isolated from solid
   tissues by digesting the extracellular matrix using enzymes such as
   collagenase, trypsin, or pronase, before agitating the tissue to
   release the cells into suspension.^[19]^[20] Alternatively, pieces of
   tissue can be placed in growth media, and the cells that grow out are
   available for culture. This method is known as explant culture.

   Cells that are cultured directly from a subject are known as primary
   cells. With the exception of some derived from tumors, most primary
   cell cultures have limited lifespan.

   An established or immortalized cell line has acquired the ability to
   proliferate indefinitely either through random mutation or deliberate
   modification, such as artificial expression of the telomerase gene.
   Numerous cell lines are well established as representative of
   particular cell types.

Maintaining cells in culture

   [edit]

   For the majority of isolated primary cells, they undergo the process of
   senescence and stop dividing after a certain number of population
   doublings while generally retaining their viability (described as the
   Hayflick limit).
   [250px-DMEM_cell_culture_medium.jpg] A bottle of DMEM cell culture
   medium

   Aside from temperature and gas mixture, the most commonly varied factor
   in culture systems is the cell growth medium.^[21] Recipes for growth
   media can vary in pH, glucose concentration, growth factors, and the
   presence of other nutrients. The growth factors used to supplement
   media are often derived from the serum of animal blood, such as fetal
   bovine serum (FBS), bovine calf serum, equine serum, and porcine serum.
   One complication of these blood-derived ingredients is the potential
   for contamination of the culture with viruses or prions, particularly
   in medical biotechnology applications. Current practice is to minimize
   or eliminate the use of these ingredients wherever possible and use
   human platelet lysate (hPL).^[22] This eliminates the worry of
   cross-species contamination when using FBS with human cells. hPL has
   emerged as a safe and reliable alternative as a direct replacement for
   FBS or other animal serum. In addition, chemically defined media can be
   used to eliminate any serum trace (human or animal), but this cannot
   always be accomplished with different cell types. Alternative
   strategies involve sourcing the animal blood from countries with
   minimum BSE/TSE risk, such as The United States, Australia and New
   Zealand,^[23] and using purified nutrient concentrates derived from
   serum in place of whole animal serum for cell culture.^[24]

   Plating density (number of cells per volume of culture medium) plays a
   critical role for some cell types. For example, a lower plating density
   makes granulosa cells exhibit estrogen production, while a higher
   plating density makes them appear as progesterone-producing theca
   lutein cells.^[25]

   Cells can be grown either in suspension or adherent cultures.^[26] Some
   cells naturally live in suspension, without being attached to a
   surface, such as cells that exist in the bloodstream. There are also
   cell lines that have been modified to be able to survive in suspension
   cultures so they can be grown to a higher density than adherent
   conditions would allow. Adherent cells require a surface, such as
   tissue culture plastic or microcarrier, which may be coated with
   extracellular matrix (such as collagen and laminin) components to
   increase adhesion properties and provide other signals needed for
   growth and differentiation. Most cells derived from solid tissues are
   adherent. Another type of adherent culture is organotypic culture,
   which involves growing cells in a three-dimensional (3-D) environment
   as opposed to two-dimensional culture dishes. This 3D culture system is
   biochemically and physiologically more similar to in vivo tissue, but
   is technically challenging to maintain because of many factors (e.g.
   diffusion).^[27]

Cell culture basal media

   [edit]

   There are different kinds of cell culture media which being used
   routinely in life science including the following:
     * MEM
     * DMEM
     * RPMI 1640
     * Ham's f-12
     * IMDM
     * Leibovitz L-15
     * DMEM/F-12
     * GMEM

Components of cell culture media

   [edit]
   Component Function
   Carbon source (glucose/glutamine) Source of energy
   Amino acid Building blocks of protein
   Vitamins Promote cell survival and growth
   Balanced salt solution An isotonic mixture of ions to maintain optimum
   osmotic pressure within the cells and provide essential metal ions to
   act as cofactors for enzymatic reactions, cell adhesion etc.
   Phenol red dye pH indicator. The color of phenol red changes from
   orange/red at pH 7–7.4 to yellow at acidic (lower) pH and purple at
   basic (higher) pH.
   Bicarbonate /HEPES buffer It is used to maintain a balanced pH in the
   media

   Relative Humidity 95%

Cell line cross-contamination

   [edit]
   Main article: List of contaminated cell lines

   Cell line cross-contamination can be a problem for scientists working
   with cultured cells.^[28] Studies suggest anywhere from 15 to 20% of
   the time, cells used in experiments have been misidentified or
   contaminated with another cell line.^[29]^[30]^[31] Problems with cell
   line cross-contamination have even been detected in lines from the
   NCI-60 panel, which are used routinely for drug-screening
   studies.^[32]^[33] Major cell line repositories, including the American
   Type Culture Collection (ATCC), the European Collection of Cell
   Cultures (ECACC) and the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell
   Cultures (DSMZ), have received cell line submissions from researchers
   that were misidentified by them.^[32]^[34] Such contamination poses a
   problem for the quality of research produced using cell culture lines,
   and the major repositories are now authenticating all cell line
   submissions.^[35] ATCC uses short tandem repeat (STR) DNA
   fingerprinting to authenticate its cell lines.^[36]

   To address this problem of cell line cross-contamination, researchers
   are encouraged to authenticate their cell lines at an early passage to
   establish the identity of the cell line. Authentication should be
   repeated before freezing cell line stocks, every two months during
   active culturing and before any publication of research data generated
   using the cell lines. Many methods are used to identify cell lines,
   including isoenzyme analysis, human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) typing,
   chromosomal analysis, karyotyping, morphology and STR analysis.^[36]

   One significant cell-line cross contaminant is the immortal HeLa cell
   line. HeLa contamination was first noted in the early 1960s in
   non-human culture in the USA. Intraspecies contamination was discovered
   in nineteen cell lines in the seventies. In 1974, five human cell lines
   from the Soviet Union were found to be HeLa. A follow-up study
   analysing 50-odd cell lines indicated that half had HeLa markers, but
   contaminant HeLa had hybridised with the original cell lines. HeLa cell
   contamination from air droplets has been reported. HeLa was even
   unknowingly injected into human subjects by Jonas Salk in a 1978
   vaccine trial.^[37]

Other technical issues

   [edit]

   As cells generally continue to divide in culture, they generally grow
   to fill the available area or volume. This can generate several issues:
     * Nutrient depletion in the growth media
     * Changes in pH of the growth media
     * Accumulation of apoptotic/necrotic (dead) cells
     * Cell-to-cell contact can stimulate cell cycle arrest, causing cells
       to stop dividing, known as contact inhibition.
     * Cell-to-cell contact can stimulate cellular differentiation.
     * Genetic and epigenetic alterations, with a natural selection of the
       altered cells potentially leading to overgrowth of abnormal,
       culture-adapted cells with decreased differentiation and increased
       proliferative capacity.^[38]

   The choice of culture medium might affect the physiological relevance
   of findings from cell culture experiments due to the differences in the
   nutrient composition and concentrations.^[39] A systematic bias in
   generated datasets was recently shown for CRISPR and RNAi gene
   silencing screens,^[40] and for metabolic profiling of cancer cell
   lines.^[39] Using a growth medium that better represents the
   physiological levels of nutrients can improve the physiological
   relevance of in vitro studies and recently such media types, as
   Plasmax^[41] and Human Plasma Like Medium (HPLM),^[42] were developed.

Manipulation of cultured cells

   [edit]

   Among the common manipulations carried out on culture cells are media
   changes, passaging cells, and transfecting cells. These are generally
   performed using tissue culture methods that rely on aseptic technique.
   Aseptic technique aims to avoid contamination with bacteria, yeast, or
   other cell lines. Manipulations are typically carried out in a
   biosafety cabinet or laminar flow cabinet to exclude contaminating
   micro-organisms. Antibiotics (e.g. penicillin and streptomycin) and
   antifungals (e.g.amphotericin B and Antibiotic-Antimycotic solution)
   can also be added to the growth media.

   As cells undergo metabolic processes, acid is produced and the pH
   decreases. Often, a pH indicator is added to the medium to measure
   nutrient depletion.

Media changes

   [edit]

   In the case of adherent cultures, the media can be removed directly by
   aspiration, and then is replaced. Media changes in non-adherent
   cultures involve centrifuging the culture and resuspending the cells in
   fresh media.

Passaging cells

   [edit]
   Main article: Passaging

   Passaging (also known as subculture or splitting cells) involves
   transferring a small number of cells into a new vessel. Cells can be
   cultured for a longer time if they are split regularly, as it avoids
   the senescence associated with prolonged high cell density. Suspension
   cultures are easily passaged with a small amount of culture containing
   a few cells diluted in a larger volume of fresh media. For adherent
   cultures, cells first need to be detached; this is commonly done with a
   mixture of trypsin-EDTA; however, other enzyme mixes are now available
   for this purpose. A small number of detached cells can then be used to
   seed a new culture. Some cell cultures, such as RAW cells are
   mechanically scraped from the surface of their vessel with rubber
   scrapers.

Transfection and transduction

   [edit]
   Main articles: Transfection and Transformation (genetics)

   Another common method for manipulating cells involves the introduction
   of foreign DNA by transfection. This is often performed to cause cells
   to express a gene of interest. More recently, the transfection of RNAi
   constructs have been realized as a convenient mechanism for suppressing
   the expression of a particular gene/protein. DNA can also be inserted
   into cells using viruses, in methods referred to as transduction,
   infection or transformation. Viruses, as parasitic agents, are well
   suited to introducing DNA into cells, as this is a part of their normal
   course of reproduction.

Established human cell lines

   [edit]
   [250px-HeLa_cells_stained_with_Hoechst_33258.jpg] Cultured HeLa cells
   have been stained with Hoechst turning their nuclei blue, and are one
   of the earliest human cell lines descended from Henrietta Lacks, who
   died of cervical cancer from which these cells originated.

   Cell lines that originate with humans have been somewhat controversial
   in bioethics, as they may outlive their parent organism and later be
   used in the discovery of lucrative medical treatments. In the
   pioneering decision in this area, the Supreme Court of California held
   in Moore v. Regents of the University of California that human patients
   have no property rights in cell lines derived from organs removed with
   their consent.^[43]
   Further information: Hybridoma

   It is possible to fuse normal cells with an immortalised cell line.
   This method is used to produce monoclonal antibodies. In brief,
   lymphocytes isolated from the spleen (or possibly blood) of an
   immunised animal are combined with an immortal myeloma cell line (B
   cell lineage) to produce a hybridoma which has the antibody specificity
   of the primary lymphocyte and the immortality of the myeloma. Selective
   growth medium (HA or HAT) is used to select against unfused myeloma
   cells; primary lymphoctyes die quickly in culture and only the fused
   cells survive. These are screened for production of the required
   antibody, generally in pools to start with and then after single
   cloning.

Cell strains

   [edit]

   A cell strain is derived either from a primary culture or a cell line
   by the selection or cloning of cells having specific properties or
   characteristics which must be defined. Cell strains are cells that have
   been adapted to culture but, unlike cell lines, have a finite division
   potential. Non-immortalized cells stop dividing after 40 to 60
   population doublings^[44] and, after this, they lose their ability to
   proliferate (a genetically determined event known as senescence).^[45]

Applications of cell culture

   [edit]

   Mass culture of animal cell lines is fundamental to the manufacture of
   viral vaccines and other products of biotechnology. Culture of human
   stem cells is used to expand the number of cells and differentiate the
   cells into various somatic cell types for transplantation.^[46] Stem
   cell culture is also used to harvest the molecules and exosomes that
   the stem cells release for the purposes of therapeutic
   development.^[47]

   Biological products produced by recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology in
   animal cell cultures include enzymes, synthetic hormones,
   immunobiologicals (monoclonal antibodies, interleukins, lymphokines),
   and anticancer agents. Although many simpler proteins can be produced
   using rDNA in bacterial cultures, more complex proteins that are
   glycosylated (carbohydrate-modified) currently must be made in animal
   cells. Mammalian cells ensure expressed proteins are folded correctly
   and possess human-like glycosylation and post-translational
   modifications.^[48] An important example of such a complex protein is
   the hormone erythropoietin. The cost of growing mammalian cell cultures
   is high, so research is underway to produce such complex proteins in
   insect cells or in higher plants, use of single embryonic cell and
   somatic embryos as a source for direct gene transfer via particle
   bombardment, transit gene expression and confocal microscopy
   observation is one of its applications. It also offers to confirm
   single cell origin of somatic embryos and the asymmetry of the first
   cell division, which starts the process.

   Cell culture is also a key technique for cellular agriculture, which
   aims to provide both new products and new ways of producing existing
   agricultural products like milk, (cultured) meat, fragrances, and rhino
   horn from cells and microorganisms. It is therefore considered one
   means of achieving animal-free agriculture. It is also a central tool
   for teaching cell biology.^[49]

Cell culture in two dimensions

   [edit]

   Research in tissue engineering, stem cells and molecular biology
   primarily involves cultures of cells on flat plastic dishes. This
   technique is known as two-dimensional (2D) cell culture, and was first
   developed by Wilhelm Roux who, in 1885, removed a portion of the
   medullary plate of an embryonic chicken and maintained it in warm
   saline for several days on a flat glass plate. From the advance of
   polymer technology arose today's standard plastic dish for 2D cell
   culture, commonly known as the Petri dish. Julius Richard Petri, a
   German bacteriologist, is generally credited with this invention while
   working as an assistant to Robert Koch. Various researchers today also
   utilize culturing laboratory flasks, conicals, and even disposable bags
   like those used in single-use bioreactors.

   Aside from Petri dishes, scientists have long been growing cells within
   biologically derived matrices such as collagen or fibrin, and more
   recently, on synthetic hydrogels such as polyacrylamide or PEG. They do
   this in order to elicit phenotypes that are not expressed on
   conventionally rigid substrates. There is growing interest in
   controlling matrix stiffness,^[50] a concept that has led to
   discoveries in fields such as:
     * Stem cell self-renewal^[51]^[52]
     * Lineage specification^[53]
     * Cancer cell phenotype^[54]^[55]^[56]
     * Fibrosis^[57]^[58]
     * Hepatocyte function^[59]^[60]^[61]
     * Mechanosensing^[62]^[63]^[64]

Cell culture in three dimensions

   [edit]

   Cell culture in three dimensions has been touted as "Biology's New
   Dimension".^[65] At present, the practice of cell culture remains based
   on varying combinations of single or multiple cell structures in
   2D.^[66] Currently, there is an increase in use of 3D cell cultures in
   research areas including drug discovery, cancer biology, regenerative
   medicine, nanomaterials assessment and basic life science
   research.^[67]^[68]^[69] 3D cell cultures can be grown using a scaffold
   or matrix, or in a scaffold-free manner. Scaffold based cultures
   utilize an acellular 3D matrix or a liquid matrix. Scaffold-free
   methods are normally generated in suspensions.^[70] There are a variety
   of platforms used to facilitate the growth of three-dimensional
   cellular structures including scaffold systems such as hydrogel
   matrices^[71] and solid scaffolds, and scaffold-free systems such as
   low-adhesion plates, nanoparticle facilitated magnetic levitation,^[72]
   hanging drop plates,^[73]^[74] and rotary cell culture. Culturing cells
   in 3D leads to wide variation in gene expression signatures and partly
   mimics tissues in the physiological states.^[75] A 3D cell culture
   model showed cell growth similar to that of in vivo than did a
   monolayer culture, and all three cultures were capable of sustaining
   cell growth.^[76] As 3D culturing has been developed it turns out to
   have a great potential to design tumors models and investigate
   malignant transformation and metastasis, 3D cultures can provide
   aggerate tool for understanding changes, interactions, and cellular
   signaling.^[77]

3D cell culture in scaffolds

   [edit]

   Eric Simon, in a 1988 NIH SBIR grant report, showed that
   electrospinning could be used to produce nano- and submicron-scale
   polystyrene and polycarbonate fibrous scaffolds specifically intended
   for use as in vitro cell substrates. This early use of electrospun
   fibrous lattices for cell culture and tissue engineering showed that
   various cell types including Human Foreskin Fibroblasts (HFF),
   transformed Human Carcinoma (HEp-2), and Mink Lung Epithelium (MLE)
   would adhere to and proliferate upon polycarbonate fibers. It was noted
   that, as opposed to the flattened morphology typically seen in 2D
   culture, cells grown on the electrospun fibers exhibited a more
   histotypic rounded 3-dimensional morphology generally observed in
   vivo.^[17]

3D cell culture in hydrogels

   [edit]

   As the natural extracellular matrix (ECM) is important in the survival,
   proliferation, differentiation and migration of cells, different
   hydrogel culture matrices mimicking natural ECM structure are seen as
   potential approaches to in vivo–like cell culturing.^[78] Hydrogels are
   composed of interconnected pores with high water retention, which
   enables efficient transport of substances such as nutrients and gases.
   Several different types of hydrogels from natural and synthetic
   materials are available for 3D cell culture, including animal ECM
   extract hydrogels, protein hydrogels, peptide hydrogels, polymer
   hydrogels, and wood-based nanocellulose hydrogel.

3D Cell Culturing by Magnetic Levitation

   [edit]

   The 3D Cell Culturing by Magnetic Levitation method (MLM) is the
   application of growing 3D tissue by inducing cells treated with
   magnetic nanoparticle assemblies in spatially varying magnetic fields
   using neodymium magnetic drivers and promoting cell to cell
   interactions by levitating the cells up to the air/liquid interface of
   a standard petri dish. The magnetic nanoparticle assemblies consist of
   magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, and the polymer
   polylysine. 3D cell culturing is scalable, with the capability for
   culturing 500 cells to millions of cells or from single dish to
   high-throughput low volume systems.

Tissue culture and engineering

   [edit]

   Cell culture is a fundamental component of tissue culture and tissue
   engineering, as it establishes the basics of growing and maintaining
   cells in vitro. The major application of human cell culture is in stem
   cell industry, where mesenchymal stem cells can be cultured and
   cryopreserved for future use. Tissue engineering potentially offers
   dramatic improvements in low cost medical care for hundreds of
   thousands of patients annually.

Vaccines

   [edit]

   Vaccines for polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox are
   currently made in cell cultures. Due to the H5N1 pandemic threat,
   research into using cell culture for influenza vaccines is being funded
   by the United States government. Novel ideas in the field include
   recombinant DNA-based vaccines, such as one made using human adenovirus
   (a common cold virus) as a vector,^[79]^[80] and novel adjuvants.^[81]

Cell co-culture

   [edit]

   The technique of co-culturing is used to study cell crosstalk between
   two or more types of cells on a plate or in a 3D matrix. The
   cultivation of different stem cells and the interaction of immune cells
   can be investigated in an in vitro model similar to biological tissue.
   Since most tissues contain more than one type of cell, it is important
   to evaluate their interaction in a 3D culture environment to gain a
   better understanding of their interaction and to introduce mimetic
   tissues. There are two types of co-culturing: direct and indirect.
   While direct interaction involves cells being in direct contact with
   each other in the same culture media or matrix, indirect interaction
   involves different environments, allowing signaling and soluble factors
   to participate.^[15]^[82]

   Cell differentiation in tissue models during interaction between cells
   can be studied using the Co-Cultured System to simulate cancer tumors,
   to assess the effect of drugs on therapeutic trials, and to study the
   effect of drugs on therapeutic trials. The co-culture system in 3D
   models can predict the response to chemotherapy and endocrine therapy
   if the microenvironment defines biological tissue for the cells.

   A co-culture method is used in tissue engineering to generate tissue
   formation with multiple cells interacting directly.^[83]

Cell culture in microfluidic device

   [edit]

   Main article: Microfluidic cell culture

   Microfluidics technique is developed systems that can perform a process
   in a flow which are usually in a scale of micron. Microfluidics chip
   are also known as Lab-on-a-chip and they are able to have continuous
   procedure and reaction steps with spare amount of reactants and space.
   Such systems enable the identification and isolation of individual
   cells and molecules when combined with appropriate biological assays
   and high-sensitivity detection techniques.^[84]^[85]

Organ-on-a-chip

   [edit]

   Main article: Organ-on-a-chip

   OoC systems mimic and control the microenvironment of the cells by
   growing tissues in microfluidics. Combining tissue engineering,
   biomaterials fabrication, and cell biology, it offers the possibility
   of establishing a biomimetic model for studying human diseases in the
   laboratory. In recent years, 3D cell culture science has made
   significant progress, leading to the development of OoC. OoC is
   considered as a preclinical step that benefits pharmaceutical studies,
   drug development and disease modeling.^[86]^[87] OoC is an important
   technology that can bridge the gap between animal testing and clinical
   studies and also by the advances that the science has achieved could be
   a replace for in vivo studies for drug delivery and pathophysiological
   studies.^[88]

Culture of non-mammalian cells

   [edit]

   Besides the culture of well-established immortalised cell lines, cells
   from primary explants of a plethora of organisms can be cultured for a
   limited period of time before senescence occurs (see Hayflick's limit).
   Cultured primary cells have been extensively used in research, as is
   the case of fish keratocytes in cell migration studies.^[89]^[49]^[90]

Plant cell culture methods

   [edit]

   Main article: Plant tissue culture

   See also: Tobacco BY-2 cells

   Plant cell cultures are typically grown as cell suspension cultures in
   a liquid medium or as callus cultures on a solid medium. The culturing
   of undifferentiated plant cells and calli requires the proper balance
   of the plant growth hormones auxin and cytokinin.^[citation needed]

Insect cell culture

   [edit]

   Main article: Insect cell culture

   Cells derived from Drosophila melanogaster (most prominently, Schneider
   2 cells) can be used for experiments which may be hard to do on live
   flies or larvae, such as biochemical studies or studies using siRNA.
   Cell lines derived from the army worm Spodoptera frugiperda, including
   Sf9 and Sf21, and from the cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni, High Five
   cells, are commonly used for expression of recombinant proteins using
   baculovirus.^[91]

Bacterial and yeast culture methods

   [edit]

   Main article: Microbiological culture

   For bacteria and yeasts, small quantities of cells are usually grown on
   a solid support that contains nutrients embedded in it, usually a gel
   such as agar, while large-scale cultures are grown with the cells
   suspended in a nutrient broth.^[citation needed]

Viral culture methods

   [edit]

   Main article: Viral culture

   The culture of viruses requires the culture of cells of mammalian,
   plant, fungal or bacterial origin as hosts for the growth and
   replication of the virus. Whole wild type viruses, recombinant viruses
   or viral products may be generated in cell types other than their
   natural hosts under the right conditions. Depending on the species of
   the virus, infection and viral replication may result in host cell
   lysis and formation of a viral plaque.^[citation needed]
