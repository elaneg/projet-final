   An Internet meme, or simply meme (/miːm/, MEEM), is a cultural item
   (such as an idea, behavior, or style) that spreads across the Internet,
   primarily through social media platforms. Internet memes manifest in a
   variety of formats, including images, videos, GIFs, and other viral
   content. Key characteristics of memes include their tendency to be
   parodied, their use of intertextuality, their viral dissemination, and
   their continual evolution. The term meme was originally introduced by
   Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene to describe the
   concept of cultural transmission.

   The term Internet meme was coined by Mike Godwin in 1993 in reference
   to the way memes proliferated through early online communities,
   including message boards, Usenet groups, and email. The emergence of
   social media platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and
   Instagram further diversified memes and accelerated their spread. Newer
   meme genres include "dank" and surrealist memes, as well as short-form
   videos popularized by platforms like Vine and TikTok. Newer internet
   memes are often defined as brain rot.

   Memes are now recognized as a significant aspect of Internet culture
   and are the subject of academic research. They appear across a broad
   spectrum of contexts, including marketing, economics, finance,
   politics, social movements, religion, and healthcare. While memes are
   often viewed as falling under fair use protection, their incorporation
   of material from pre-existing works can result in copyright disputes.

Characteristics

   Internet memes derive from the original concept of memes as units of
   cultural transmission, passed from person to person. In the digital
   realm, this transmission occurs primarily through online platforms,
   such as social media.^[1] Although related, internet memes differ from
   traditional memes in that they often represent fleeting trends, whereas
   the success of traditional memes is measured by their endurance over
   time. Additionally, internet memes tend to be less abstract in nature
   compared to their traditional counterparts.^[2] They are highly
   versatile in form and purpose, serving as tools for light
   entertainment, self-expression, social commentary, and even political
   discourse.^[3]

   Two fundamental characteristics of internet memes are creative
   reproduction and intertextuality.^[4] Creative reproduction refers to
   the adaptation and transformation of a meme through imitation or
   parody, either by reproducing the meme in a new context ("mimicry") or
   by remixing the original material ("remix"). In mimicry, the meme is
   recreated in a different setting, as seen when different individuals
   replicate the viral video "Charlie Bit My Finger". Remix, on the other
   hand, involves technological manipulation, such as altering an image
   with Photoshop, while retaining elements of the original meme.^[4]

   Intertextuality in memes involves the blending of different cultural
   references or contexts. An example of this is the combination of US
   politician Mitt Romney's phrase "binders full of women" from the 2012
   US presidential debate with a scene from the Korean pop song "Gangnam
   Style". In this case, the phrase "my binders full of women exploded" is
   superimposed on a frame from Psy's music video, creating a new meaning
   by merging political and cultural references from distinct
   contexts.^[4]

   Internet memes can also function as in-jokes within specific online
   communities, where they convey insider knowledge that may be
   incomprehensible to outsiders. This fosters a sense of collective
   identity within the group.^[5] Conversely, some memes achieve
   widespread cultural relevance, being understood and appreciated by
   broader audiences outside of the originating subculture.^[3]

   A study by Michele Knobel and Colin Lankshear examined how Richard
   Dawkins' three characteristics of successful traditional
   memes—fidelity, fecundity, and longevity—apply to internet memes. It
   was found that fidelity in the context of internet memes is better
   described as replicability, as memes are frequently modified through
   remixing while still maintaining their core message. Fecundity, or the
   ability of a meme to spread, is promoted by factors such as humor (such
   as the comically translated video game line "All your base are belong
   to us"), intertextuality (as in the various pop culture-referencing
   renditions of the "Star Wars Kid" viral video), and juxtaposition of
   seemingly incongruous elements (exemplified in the "Bert is Evil"
   meme). Finally, longevity is essential for a meme's continued
   circulation and evolution over time.^[6]

Evolution and propagation

   Internet meme propagation graph Internet memes propagate in a similar
   pattern to infectious disease, as shown by this SIR model. The pattern,
   as depicted in red, shows an initial spike in popularity followed by a
   gradual taper to obscurity.

   Internet memes can either remain consistent or evolve over time. This
   evolution may involve changes in meaning while retaining the meme’s
   structure, or vice versa, with such transformations occurring either by
   chance or through deliberate efforts like parody.^[7] A study by
   Miltner examined the lolcats meme, tracing its development from an
   in-joke within computer and gaming communities on the website 4chan to
   a broader source of humor and emotional support. As the meme entered
   mainstream culture, it lost favor with its original creators. Miltner
   explained that as content moves through different communities, it is
   reinterpreted to suit the specific needs and desires of those
   communities, often diverging from the creator’s original intent.^[5]
   Modifications to memes can lead them to transcend social and cultural
   boundaries.^[8]

   Memes spread virally, in a manner similar to the SIR
   (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model used to describe the
   transmission of diseases.^[9] Once a meme has reached a critical number
   of individuals, its continued spread becomes inevitable.^[10] Research
   by Coscia examined the factors contributing to a meme’s propagation and
   longevity, concluding that while memes compete for attention—often
   resulting in shorter lifespans—they can also collaborate, enhancing
   their chances of survival. A meme that experiences an exceptionally
   high peak in popularity is unlikely to endure unless it is uniquely
   distinct. Conversely, a meme without such a peak, but that coexists
   with others, tends to have greater longevity.^[11] In 2013, Dominic
   Basulto, writing for The Washington Post, argued that the widespread
   use of memes, particularly by the marketing and advertising industries,
   has led to a decline in their original cultural value. Once considered
   valuable cultural artifacts meant to endure, memes now often convey
   trivial rather than meaningful ideas.^[12]

History

Origins and early memes

   Image of lolcat meme A lolcat image macro, a meme style especially
   popular in the mid-and-late 2000s

   The word meme was coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The
   Selfish Gene as an attempt to explain how aspects of culture replicate,
   mutate, and evolve (memetics).^[13] Emoticons are among the earliest
   examples of internet memes, specifically the smiley emoticon ":-)",
   introduced by Scott Fahlman in 1982.^[14] The concept of memes in an
   online context was formally proposed by Mike Godwin in the June 1993
   issue of Wired.^[15] In 2013, Dawkins characterized an Internet meme as
   being a meme deliberately altered by human creativity—distinguished
   from biological genes and his own pre-Internet concept of a meme, which
   involved mutation by random change and spreading through accurate
   replication as in Darwinian selection. Dawkins explained that Internet
   memes are thus a "hijacking of the original idea", evolving the very
   concept of a meme in this new direction.^[16] Nevertheless, by 2013,
   Limor Shifman solidified the relationship of memes to internet culture
   and reworked Dawkins' concept for online contexts.^[17] Such an
   association has been shown to be empirically valuable as internet memes
   carry an additional property that Dawkins' "memes" do not: internet
   memes leave a footprint in the media through which they propagate (for
   example, social networks) that renders them traceable and
   analyzable.^[11]

   However, before internet memes were considered truly academic, they
   were initially a colloquial reference to humorous visual communication
   online in the mid-late 1990s among internet denizens; examples of these
   early internet memes include the Dancing Baby and Hampster Dance.^[18]
   Memes of this time were primarily spread via messageboards, Usenet
   groups, and email, and generally lasted for a longer time than modern
   memes.^[19]
   [250px-Doge_meme_example.jpg] An example of the Doge meme, popular in
   2013 and similar in style to earlier lolcats^[20]

   As the Internet protocols evolved, so did memes. Lolcats originated
   from imageboard website 4chan, becoming the prototype of the "image
   macro" format (an image overlaid by large text).^[19] Other early forms
   of image-based memes included demotivators (parodized motivational
   posters), photoshopped images, comics (such as rage comics),^[21]^[22]
   and anime fan art,^[23] sometimes made by doujin circles in various
   countries. After the release of YouTube in 2005, video-based memes such
   as Rickrolling and viral videos such as "Gangnam Style" and the Harlem
   shake emerged.^[19]^[24] The appearance of social media websites such
   as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram provided additional mediums for the
   spread of memes,^[25] and the creation of meme-generating websites made
   their production more accessible.^[19]

Contemporary memes

   [250px-WikiMeme_Dank.jpg] example of a Dank meme

   "Dank memes" are a genre of internet memes, which reached mainstream
   prominence around 2014. Dank memes refer to deliberately zany or odd
   memes with features such as oversaturated colors, compression
   artifacts, crude humor, strange captions, and overly loud sounds
   (termed ear rape).^[26]^[27] The term dank, which refers to cold, damp
   places, was adapted as a way to describe memes that fit the
   aforementioned criteria of a dank meme.^[26]^[28] The term may also be
   used to describe memes that have become overused and stale to the point
   of paradoxically becoming humorous again. Despite having lost
   popularity since the late 2010s, dank memes have seen several "revival"
   attempts, popularised on platforms such as TikTok.^[29] The phenomenon
   of dank memes sprouted a subculture called the "meme market",
   satirizing Wall Street and applying the associated jargon (such as
   "stocks") to internet memes. Originally started on Reddit as
   /r/MemeEconomy, users jokingly "buy" or "sell" shares in a meme
   reflecting opinion on its potential popularity.^[30]
   [250px-Deep_fried_meme.jpg] Example of a "deep-fried" meme, featuring
   distortion and saturated colors

   "Deep-fried" memes refer to those that have been distorted and run
   through several filters and/or layers of lossy compression.^[31]^[32]
   An example of these is the "E" meme, a picture of YouTuber Markiplier
   photoshopped onto Lord Farquaad from the film Shrek, in turn
   photoshopped into a scene from businessman Mark Zuckerberg's hearing in
   Congress and captioned with a lone 'E'.^[33] Elizabeth Bruenig of the
   Washington Post described this as a "digital update to the surreal and
   absurd genres of art and literature that characterized the tumultuous
   early 20th century".^[34] Many modern memes make use of humorously
   absurd and even surrealist themes. Examples of the former include "they
   did surgery on a grape", a video depicting a Da Vinci Surgical System
   performing test surgery on a grape,^[35] and the "moth meme", a
   close-up picture of a moth with captions humorously conveying the
   insect's love of lamps.^[36] Surreal memes incorporate layers of irony
   to make them unique and nonsensical, often as a means of escapism from
   mainstream meme culture.^[37]
   [250px-Thousand_yard_stare_meme.png] The "Thousand Yard Stare Meme",
   which was popular in 2023^[38]

   After the success of the application Vine, a format of memes emerged in
   the form of short videos and scripted sketches. An example is the
   "What's Nine Plus Ten?" meme, a Vine video depicting a child humorously
   providing an incorrect answer to a math problem.^[39] After the
   shutdown of Vine in 2017, the de facto replacement became Chinese
   social network TikTok, which similarly utilizes the short video
   format.^[40] The platform has become immensely popular, and is the
   source of many genres of internet memes as of the mid 2020s.^[41]^[42]

   In 2022, the term brain rot became used to reflect a shift in how
   memes, particularly TikTok videos, were being interacted with. The term
   describes content lacking in quality and meaning, often associated with
   slang and trends popular among Generation Alpha, such as "skibidi",
   "rizz", "gyatt", "sigma" and "fanum tax".^[43] The name comes from the
   perceived negative psychological and cognitive effects caused by
   exposure to such content.^[44]
   [250px-Six-seven_jack-o-lantern%2C_Toronto_2025.jpg] Some Internet
   memes have been criticized for being deliberately meaningless and
   nonsensical, such as the 6-7 meme (pictured)^[45]

   By 2024, news outlets documented the spread of AI-generated memes on
   major platforms, noting their growing role in shaping online
   discourse.^[46] In 2025, some TikTok users expressed concern over a
   "meme drought", which was said to be caused by a cringe culture
   community known as SlimeTok.^[47] The meme drought was also used to
   criticize AI-inspired brainrot trends and deliberately meaningless
   content such as 6-7 from Gen Z and Gen Alpha for being "oversaturated
   and unfunny". They called for a "Great Meme Reset" on January 1, 2026,
   returning to memes from the 2010s such as Nyan Cat and Big
   Chungus.^[48]

By context

Marketing

   The practice of using memes to market products or services has been
   termed "memetic marketing".^[49] Internet memes allow brands to
   circumvent the conception of advertisements as irksome, making them
   less overt and more tailored to the likes of their target audience.
   Marketing personnel may choose to utilize an existing meme, or create a
   new meme from scratch. Fashion house Gucci employed the former
   strategy, launching a series of Instagram ads that reimagined popular
   memes featuring its watch collection. The image macro "The Most
   Interesting Man in the World" is an example of the latter, a meme
   generated from an advertising campaign for the Dos Equis beer
   brand.^[50] Products may also gain popularity through internet memes
   without intention by the producer themselves; for instance, the film
   Snakes on a Plane became a cult classic after creation of the website
   SnakesOnABlog.com by law student Brian Finkelstein.^[51]

   Use of memes by brands, while often advantageous, has been subject to
   criticism for seemingly forced, unoriginal, or unfunny usage of memes,
   which can negatively impact a brand's image.^[52] For example, the fast
   food company Wendy's began a social media-based approach to marketing
   that was initially met with success (resulting in an almost 50% profit
   growth that year), but received criticism after sharing a controversial
   Pepe meme that was negatively perceived by consumers.^[53]

Economics and finance

   Further information: Meme stocks

   Meme stocks are a phenomenon where stock values for a company rise
   significantly in a short period due to a surge in interest online and
   subsequent buying by investors. Video game retailer GameStop is
   recognized as the first meme stock.^[54] r/WallStreetBets, a subreddit
   where participants discuss stock trading, and Robinhood Markets, a
   financial services company, became notable in 2021 for their
   involvement in the popularisation of meme stocks.^[55]^[56] "YOLO
   investors" are a phenomenon that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic,
   who are less risk averse in their investments compared to their
   traditional counterparts.^[57]

   Additionally, memes have developed an association with cryptocurrency
   with the development of meme currencies such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu
   Coin, and Pepe Coin. Meme cryptocurrencies have suggested comparisons
   between meme value and monetary markets.^[58]^[59]

Politics

   Internet memes are a medium for fast communication to large online
   audiences, which has led to their use by those seeking to express a
   political opinion or actively campaign for (or against) a political
   entity.^[14]^[60] In some ways, they can be seen as a modern form of
   the political cartoon, offering a way to democratize political
   commentary.^[61]

   Among the earliest political memes were those arising from the viral
   Dean scream, an excerpt from a speech delivered by Vermont governor
   Howard Dean.^[62] Over time, Internet memes have become an increasingly
   important element in political campaigns, as online communities
   contribute to broader discourse through the use of memes.^[63] For
   example, Ted Cruz's 2016 Republican presidential bid was damaged by a
   meme that jokingly speculated he was the Zodiac Killer.^[64]

   Research has shown the use of memes during elections has a role to play
   in informing the public on political themes. A study explored this in
   relation to the 2017 UK general election, and concluded that memes
   acted as a widely shared conduit for basic political information to
   audiences who would usually not seek it out.^[65] They also found that
   memes may play some role in increasing voter turnout.^[65]

   Some political campaigns have begun to explicitly taken advantage of
   the increasing influence of memes; as part of the 2020 US presidential
   campaign, Michael Bloomberg sponsored a number of Instagram accounts
   (with over 60 million followers collectively) to post memes related to
   the Bloomberg campaign.^[66] The campaign was faulted for treating
   memes as a commodity that can be bought.^[67]

   Beyond their use in elections, Internet memes can become symbols for
   various political ideologies. A salient example is Pepe the Frog, which
   has been used as a symbol for the alt-right political movement, as well
   as for pro-democracy ideologies in the 2019–2020 Hong Kong
   protests.^[68]^[69]

Social movements

   [250px-John_Maino_performs_the_ALS_Ice_Bucket_Challenge.jpg] A person
   performing the Ice Bucket Challenge

   Internet memes can be powerful tools in social movements, constructing
   collective identity and providing platform for discourse.^[3]^[70]
   During the 2010 It Gets Better Project for LGBTQ+ empowerment, memes
   were used to uplift LGBTQ+ youth while negotiating the community's
   collective identity.^[71] In 2014, the viral Ice Bucket Challenge
   raised money and awareness for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/Motor
   Neurone Disease (ALS/MND).^[72] Furthermore, internet memes proved an
   important medium in the discourse surrounding the Occupy Wall Street
   (OWS) movement.^[73]

Religion

   Internet memes have also been used in the context of religion.^[74]
   They create a participatory culture that enables individuals to
   collectively make meaning of religious beliefs, reflecting a form of
   lived religion.^[75] Aguilar et al. of Texas A&M University identified
   six common genres of religious memes: non-religious image macros with
   religious themes, image macros featuring religious figures, memes
   reacting to religion-related news, memes deifying non-religious figures
   such as celebrities, spoofs of religious images, and video-based
   memes.^[75]

Healthcare

   Social media platforms can increase the speed of dissemination of
   evidence-based health practices.^[76] A study by Reynolds and Boyd
   found the majority of participants (who were healthcare staff) felt
   that memes could be an appropriate means of improving healthcare
   worker's knowledge of and compliance with infection prevention
   practices.^[77] Internet memes were also used in Nigeria to raise
   awareness of the COVID-19 pandemic, with healthcare professionals using
   the medium to disseminate information on the virus and its
   vaccine.^[78]

Copyright

   Since many memes are derived from pre-existing works, it has been
   contended that memes violate the copyright of the original authors.
   However, some view memes as falling under the ambit of fair use in the
   United States.^[79]^[80] This dilemma has caused conflict between meme
   producers and copyright owners; for example, Getty Images' demand for
   payment from the blog Get Digital for publishing the "Socially Awkward
   Penguin" meme without permission.^[81]

United States

   Under United States copyright law, copyright protection subsists in
   "original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of
   expression, now known or later developed, from which they can be
   perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or
   with the aid of a machine or device". It is disputed whether the use of
   memes constitutes copyright infringement.^[79]
   [250px-Farmer_meme_with_apostrophe.jpg] This image macro is in the
   public domain in the United States as the background was taken by the
   Department of Agriculture.

   Fair use is a defense under US copyright law which protects work made
   using other copyrighted works.^[82] Section 107 of the 1976 Copyright
   Act outlines four factors for analysis of fair use:
    1. The purpose and character of the use,
    2. The nature of the copyrighted work,
    3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used, and
    4. The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the
       copyrighted work.^[79]

   The first factor implies the secondary use of a copyrighted work should
   be "transformative" (that is, giving novel meaning or expression to the
   original work); many memes fulfil this criterion, placing pieces of
   media in a new context to serve a different purpose to that of the
   original author. The second factor favors copied works drawing from
   factual sources, which may be problematic for memes derived from
   fictional works (such as films). Many of these memes, however, only use
   small portions of such works (such as still images), favoring an
   argument of fair use per the third factor. With regards to the fourth
   factor, most memes are non-commercial in nature and thus would not have
   adverse effects on the potential market for the copyright work.^[79]
   Given these factors, and the overall reliance of memes on appropriation
   of other sources, it has been argued that they deserve protection from
   copyright infringement suits.^[82]

Non-fungible tokens

   Some individuals who are subjects of memes (and thus the copyright
   holders) have made money through sale of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in
   auctions.^[83] Ben Lashes, a manager of numerous memes, stated their
   sales as NFTs made over US$2 million and established memes as serious
   forms of art.^[84] One example is Disaster Girl, based on a photo of
   Zoe Roth at age 4 taken in Mebane, North Carolina, in January
   2005.^[84] After this photo became famous and was used hundreds of
   times without permission, Roth decided to sell the original copy as an
   NFT for US$539,973 (equivalent to $626,576 in 2024),^[85] with an
   agreement for a further 10 percent share of any future sales.^[86]
