   Indigenous peoples^[a] are non-dominant people groups descended from
   the original inhabitants of their territories, especially territories
   that have been colonized.^[1]^[2]^[3] The term lacks a precise
   authoritative definition,^[4]^[3]^[5] although in the 21st century
   designations of Indigenous peoples have focused on self-identification,
   cultural difference from other groups in a state, a special
   relationship with their traditional territory, and an experience of
   subjugation and discrimination under a dominant cultural model.^[6]

   Estimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range from 250
   million to 600 million.^[7] There are some 5,000 distinct Indigenous
   peoples spread across every inhabited climate zone and inhabited
   continent of the world.^[8]^[9] Most Indigenous peoples are in a
   minority in the state or traditional territory they inhabit and have
   experienced domination by other groups, especially non-Indigenous
   peoples.^[10]^[11] Although many Indigenous peoples have experienced
   colonization by settlers from European nations,^[12] Indigenous
   identity is not determined by Western colonization.^[6]

   The rights of Indigenous peoples are outlined in national legislation,
   treaties and international law. The 1989 International Labour
   Organization (ILO) Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples protects
   Indigenous peoples from discrimination and specifies their rights to
   development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources,
   employment, education and health.^[13] In 2007, the United Nations (UN)
   adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples including
   their rights to self-determination and to protect their cultures,
   identities, languages, ceremonies, and access to employment, health,
   education and natural resources.^[14]

   Indigenous peoples continue to face threats to their sovereignty,
   economic well-being, languages, cultural heritage, and access to the
   resources on which their cultures depend.^[15] In the 21st century,
   Indigenous groups and advocates for Indigenous peoples have highlighted
   numerous apparent violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples.

Etymology

   Indigenous is derived from the Latin word indigena, meaning "sprung
   from the land, native".^[16] The Latin indigena is based on the Old
   Latin indu "in, within" + gignere "to beget, produce". Indu is an
   extended form of the Proto-Indo-European en or "in".^[17]^[18]

Definitions

   [250px-Amis_postcard.jpg] Colorized photograph of an Amis couple in
   traditional clothing. Taken in pre–World War II Japanese-ruled Taiwan.

   There is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous peoples in the
   United Nations or international law.^[19] Various national and
   international organizations, non-government organizations, governments,
   Indigenous groups and scholars have developed definitions or have
   declined to provide a definition.^[5]

Historical

   As a reference to a group of people, the term "indigenous" was first
   used by Europeans to differentiate the Indigenous peoples of the
   Americas from enslaved Africans. The first known use was by Sir Thomas
   Browne in 1646, who wrote "and although in many parts thereof there be
   at present swarms of Negroes serving under the Spaniard, yet were they
   all transported from Africa, since the discovery of Columbus; and are
   not indigenous or proper natives of America."^[20]^[21]

   In the 1970s, the term was used as a way of linking the experiences,
   issues, and struggles of groups of colonized people across
   international borders. At this time 'indigenous people(s)' also began
   to be used to describe a legal category in Indigenous law created in
   international and national legislation. The use of the plural 'peoples'
   recognizes the cultural differences between various Indigenous
   peoples.^[22]^[page needed]^[23]

   The first meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous
   Populations (WGIP) was on 9 August 1982 and this date is now celebrated
   as the International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples.^[24]

Recent

   In the 21st century, the concept of Indigenous peoples is understood in
   a wider context than only the colonial experience. The focus has been
   on self-identification as indigenous peoples, cultural difference from
   other groups in a state, a special relationship with their traditional
   territory, and an experience of subjugation and discrimination under a
   dominant cultural model.^[6]

United Nations

   No definition of Indigenous peoples has been adopted by a United
   Nations agency. The Secretariat of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous
   Issues states, "in the case of the concept of 'indigenous peoples', the
   prevailing view today is that no formal universal definition of the
   term is necessary, given that a single definition will inevitably be
   either over- or under-inclusive, making sense in some societies but not
   in others."^[2]

   However, a number of UN agencies have provided statements of coverage
   for particular international agreements concerning Indigenous peoples
   or "working definitions" for particular reports.^[2]

   The International Labour Organization's (ILO) Indigenous and Tribal
   Peoples Convention, 1989 (ILO Convention No. 169), states that the
   convention covers

     peoples in independent countries who are regarded as indigenous on
     account of their descent from the populations which inhabited the
     country, or a geographical region to which the country belongs, at
     the time of conquest or colonisation or the establishment of present
     state boundaries and who, irrespective of their legal status, retain
     some or all of their own social, economic, cultural and political
     institutions.^[25]

   The convention also covers "tribal peoples" who are distinguished from
   Indigenous peoples and described as "tribal peoples in independent
   countries whose social, cultural and economic conditions distinguish
   them from other sections of the national community and whose status is
   regulated wholly or partially by their own customs or traditions or by
   special laws or regulations."^[26]

   The convention states that self-identification as indigenous or tribal
   is a fundamental criterion for determining the groups to which the
   convention applies.^[19] The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
   Peoples does not define Indigenous peoples but affirms their right to
   self-determination including determining their own identity.^[27]

Inter-American Commission on Human Rights

   The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights does not provide a
   definition of Indigenous peoples stating that, "such a definition is
   not necessary for purposes of protecting their human rights." In
   determining coverage of Indigenous peoples, the commission uses the
   criteria developed in documents such as ILO Convention No. 169 and the
   United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The
   commission states that self-identification as indigenous is a
   fundamental criterion.^[3]

World Bank

   The World Bank states, "Indigenous Peoples are distinct social and
   cultural groups that share collective ancestral ties to the lands and
   natural resources where they live, occupy or from which they have been
   displaced."^[28]

Amnesty International

   Amnesty International does not provide a definition of Indigenous
   peoples but states that they can be identified according to certain
   characteristics:^[29]
     * Self identification as Indigenous peoples
     * A historical link with those who inhabited a country or region at
       the time when people of different cultures or ethnic origins
       arrived
     * A strong link to territories and surrounding natural resources
     * Distinct social, economic or political systems
     * A distinct language, culture and beliefs
     * Marginalized and discriminated against by the state
     * They maintain and develop their ancestral environments and systems
       as distinct peoples

Scholars

   Academics and other scholars have developed various definitions of
   Indigenous peoples. In 1986–87, José Martínez Cobo, the UN Special
   Rapporteur on the problem of discrimination against indigenous
   populations, developed the following "working definition":

     Indigenous communities, peoples, and nations are those that, having
     a historical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies
     that developed on their territories, consider themselves distinct
     from other sectors of the societies now prevailing in those
     territories, or parts of them. They form at present non-dominant
     sectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop, and
     transmit to future generations their ancestral territories, and
     their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence as
     peoples, in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social
     institutions and legal systems.^[30]

   Martínez Cobo states that the following factors are relevant to
   historical continuity: occupation of ancestral lands, or at least of
   part of them; common ancestry with the original occupants of these
   lands; cultural factors such as religion, tribalism, dress, etc.;
   language; residence in certain parts of the country, or in certain
   regions of the world; and other relevant factors.^[31]

   clothing from the town of Santa Catarina Palopó on Lake Atitlán

   In 2004, professor of human rights law and policy James Anaya, defined
   Indigenous peoples as "living descendants of pre-invasion inhabitants
   of lands now dominated by others. They are culturally distinct groups
   that find themselves engulfed by other settler societies born of forces
   of empire and conquest".^[32]

   In 2012, Indigenous studies scholars Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang
   proposed a criterion based on accounts of origin: "Indigenous peoples
   are those who have creation stories, not colonization stories, about
   how we/they came to be in a particular place – indeed how we/they came
   to be a place. Our/their relationships to land comprise our/their
   epistemologies, ontologies, and cosmologies".^[33] Indigenous peoples
   such as the Maasai and the Māori have oral traditional histories
   involving migration to their current location from somewhere else.^[34]

   Anthropologist Manvir Singh states that the term may lack coherence,
   pointing to inconsistencies in which ethnic groups are called
   Indigenous or not, and notes several scholars who suggest that it
   instead acts as a relabeling of discredited and colonial ideas about
   "primitive" people.^[34] Singh states that some Indigenous people argue
   that the term and identity has resulted in pressure to appear
   "primordial" and "unchanging", and erases complex and modern
   identities.^[34]

   Other scholars, such as Dominic O'Sullivan and Marjo Lindroth, have
   analysed and defined Indigenous peoples as those in a specific
   power-relationship with the state, called "indigeneity", that has come
   about due to the process of settler-colonialism.^[35]^[36]^[37]

Other views

   It is sometimes argued that all Africans are Indigenous to Africa, all
   Asians are Indigenous to parts of Asia, or that there can be no
   Indigenous peoples in countries which did not experience large-scale
   Western settler colonialism.^[6] Many countries have avoided the term
   "Indigenous peoples" or have denied that indigenous peoples exist in
   their territory, and have classified minorities who identify as
   Indigenous in other ways, such as 'hill tribes' in Thailand, 'scheduled
   tribes' in India, 'national minorities' in China, 'cultural minorities'
   in the Philippines, 'isolated and alien peoples' in Indonesia, and
   various other terms.^[5]

History

Classical antiquity

   Greek sources of the Classical period acknowledge Indigenous people
   whom they referred to as "Pelasgians". Ancient writers saw these people
   either as the ancestors of the Greeks,^[38] or as an earlier group of
   people who inhabited Greece before the Greeks.^[39] The disposition and
   precise identity of this former group is elusive, and sources such as
   Homer, Hesiod and Herodotus give varying, partially mythological
   accounts. Dionysius of Halicarnassus in his book, Roman Antiquities,
   gives a synoptic interpretation of the Pelasgians based on the sources
   available to him then, concluding that Pelasgians were Greek.^[40]

Africa

   In European late antiquity, many Berbers, Copts and Nubians of north
   Africa converted to various forms of Christianity under Roman rule,
   although elements of traditional religious beliefs were retained.^[41]
   Following the Arab invasions of North Africa in the 7th century, many
   Berbers were enslaved or recruited into the army. The majority of
   Berbers, however, remained nomadic pastoralists who also engaged in
   trade as far as sub-Saharan Africa.^[42] Coptic Egyptians remained in
   possession of their lands and many preserved their language and
   Christian religion. By the 10th century, however, the majority of the
   population of north Africa spoke Arabic and practiced Islam.^[43]

   From 1402, the Guanche of the Canary Islands resisted Spanish attempts
   at colonization. The islands finally came under Spanish control in
   1496. Mohamed Adhikari has called the conquest of the islands a
   genocide.^[44]^[45]

   Early 15th-century Portuguese exploration of the west coast of Africa
   was motivated by a quest for gold and crusading against Islam.^[46]
   Portugal's first attempt at colonization in what is now Senegal ended
   in failure.^[47] In the 1470s, the Portuguese established a fortified
   trading post on the West coast of Africa, south of the Akan goldfields.
   The Portuguese engaged in extensive trade of goods for gold and, in
   later years, slaves for their sugar plantations in the islands off West
   Africa and in the New World.^[48] In 1488, Portuguese ships rounded the
   Cape of Good Hope^[49] and by the 17th century, Portugal had
   established seaborn trading routes and fortified coastal trading posts
   from West Africa to India and Southern China, and a settler colony in
   Brazil.^[50]

   In 1532, the first African slaves were transported directly to the
   Americas. The trade in slaves expanded sharply in the 17th century,
   with the involvement of the French, Dutch and English, before declining
   in the 19th century. At least 12 million slaves were transported from
   Africa.^[51] The slave trade increased inter-tribal warfare and stunted
   population growth and economic development in the west African
   interior.^[52]^[53]

Americas

   See also: Age of Discovery

   Indigenous encounters with Europeans increased during the age of
   discovery. The Europeans were motivated by a range of factors including
   trade,^[44]^[54] the exploitation of natural resources,^[44]^[55]
   spreading Christianity,^[56] and establishing strategic military bases,
   colonies and settlements.^[57]

   From 1492, the Arawak peoples of the Caribbean islands encountered
   Spanish colonizers initially led by Christopher Columbus. The Spanish
   enslaved some of the native population and forced others to work on
   farms and gold mines in a system of labor called encomienda. Spanish
   settlements spread from Hispaniola to Puerto Rico, the Bahamas and
   Cuba, leading to a severe decline in the Indigenous populations from
   disease, malnutrition, settler violence and cultural
   disruption.^[58]^[59]

   In the 1520s, the peoples of Mesoamerica encountered the Spanish who
   entered their lands in search of gold and other resources. Some
   indigenous peoples chose to ally with the Spanish to end Aztec rule.
   The Spanish incursions led to the conquest of the Aztec Empire and its
   fall. The Cempoalans, Tlaxcalans and other allies of the Spanish were
   given some autonomy, but the Spanish were de facto rulers of Mexico.
   Smallpox devastated the indigenous population and aided the Spanish
   conquest.^[60]
   [500px-Age_of_Discovery_explorations_in_English.png] Map with the main
   travels of the Age of Discovery (which began in the 15th century)

   In 1530, the Spanish sailed south from Panama to the lands of the Inca
   Empire in the west of South America. The Inca, weakened by a smallpox
   epidemic and civil war, were defeated by the Spanish at Cajamarca in
   1532, and the emperor Atahualpa was captured and executed. The Spanish
   appointed a puppet emperor and captured the Inca capital of Cuzco with
   the support of a number of native peoples. The Spanish established a
   new capital in 1535 and defeated an Inca rebellion in 1537, thus
   consolidating the conquest of Peru.^[61]

   In the 1560s, the Spanish established colonies in Florida and in 1598
   founded a colony in New Mexico.^[62] However, the heartland of the
   Spanish colonies remained New Spain (including Mexico and most of
   Central America) and Peru (including most of South America).^[63]

   In the 17th century, French, English and Dutch trading posts multiplied
   in northern America to exploit whaling, fishing and fur trading. French
   settlements progressed up the St Lawrence river to the Great Lakes and
   down the Mississippi to Louisiana.^[64] English and Dutch settlements
   multiplied down the Atlantic coast from modern Massachusetts to
   Georgia.^[65] Native peoples formed alliances with the Europeans in
   order to promote trade, preserve their autonomy, and gain allies in
   conflicts with other native peoples.^[64]^[66] However, horses and new
   weapons made inter-tribal conflicts more deadly and the native
   population was devastated by introduced diseases. Native peoples also
   experienced losses from violent conflict with the colonists and the
   progressive dispossession of their traditional lands.^[67]
   [250px-LienzodeTlaxcalaLamina5.jpg] Depiction of a Spaniard entering
   Chalco with three Tlaxcalan soldiers and an Indigenous porter in the
   Lienzo de Tlaxcala (pre-1585)

   In 1492, the population of the Americas as a whole was about 50 to
   100 million. By 1700, introduced diseases had reduced the native
   population by 90%.^[68] European migration and transfer of slaves from
   Africa reduced the native population to a minority. By 1800 the
   population of North America comprised about 5 million Europeans and
   their descendants, one million Africans and 600,000 indigenous
   Americans.^[69]

   Native populations also encountered new animals and plants introduced
   by Europeans. These included pigs, horses, mules, sheep and cattle;
   wheat, barley, rye, oats, grasses and grapevines. These exotic animals
   and plants radically transformed the local environment and disrupted
   traditional agriculture and hunting practices.^[69]

Oceania

   The indigenous populations of the Pacific had increasing contact with
   Europeans in the 18th century as British, French and Spanish
   expeditions explored the region. The natives of Tahiti had encounters
   with the expeditions of Wallis (1766), Bougainville (1768), Cook (1769)
   and many others before being colonized by the French.^[70] The
   indigenous inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands first encountered
   Europeans in 1778 when Cook explored the region.^[71] Following
   increasing contact with European missionaries, traders and scientific
   expeditions, the indigenous population fell before their lands were
   annexed by the United States in 1893.^[72]

   The Māori of New Zealand also had sporadic encounters with Europeans in
   the 17th and 18th centuries. Following encounters with Cook's
   exploration parties in 1769–70, New Zealand was visited by numerous
   European and North American whaling, sealing, and trading ships.^[73]
   From the early 19th century, Christian missionaries began to settle New
   Zealand, eventually converting most of the Māori population.^[74] The
   Māori population declined to around 40% of its pre-contact level during
   the 19th century; introduced diseases were the major factor.^[75] New
   Zealand became a British Crown colony in 1841.^[76]^[77]

   The Aboriginal inhabitants of Australia, after brief encounters with
   European explorers in the 17th and 18th centuries, had extensive
   contact with Europeans when the continent was progressively colonized
   by the British from 1788. During colonization, the Aboriginal people
   experienced depopulation from disease and settler violence,
   dispossession of their land, and severe disruption of their traditional
   cultures. By 1850, indigenous peoples were a minority in
   Australia.^[78]

European justifications for colonization

   See also: Discovery doctrine

   From the 15th to the 19th centuries, European powers used a number of
   rationales for the colonization of newly encountered lands populated by
   indigenous peoples. These included a duty to spread the Gospel to
   non-Christians, to bring civilization to barbarian peoples, a natural
   law right to explore and trade freely with other peoples, and a right
   to settle and cultivate uninhabited or uncultivated land which they
   considered terra nullius ("no one's land").^[79]

   Robert J. Miller, Jacinta Ruru, Larissa Behrendt and Tracey Lindberg
   argue that European powers rationalized their colonization of the New
   World by the discovery doctrine, which they trace back to papal decrees
   authorizing Spain and Portugal to conquer newly discovered
   non-Christian lands and convert their populations to Christianity.^[80]
   Kent McNeil, however, states, "While Spain and Portugal favoured
   discovery and papal grants because it was generally in their interests
   to do so, France and Britain relied more on symbolic acts, colonial
   charters, and occupation."^[81] Benton and Strauman argue that European
   powers often adopted multiple, sometimes contradictory, legal
   rationales for their acquisition of territory as a deliberate strategy
   in defending their claims against European rivals.^[82]

Settler independence and continuing colonialism

   See also: Settler colonialism

   Although the establishment of colonies throughout the world by various
   European powers aimed to expand those powers' wealth and influence,
   settler populations in some localities became anxious to assert their
   own autonomy. For example, settler independence movements in thirteen
   of the British American colonies were successful by 1783, following the
   American Revolutionary War. This resulted in the establishment of the
   United States of America as an entity separate from the British Empire.
   The United States continued and expanded European colonial doctrine
   through adopting a version of the discovery doctrine as law in 1823
   with the US Supreme Court case Johnson v. McIntosh. Statements at the
   Johnson court case illuminated the United States' support for the
   principles of the discovery doctrine:^[83]

     The United States ... [and] its civilized inhabitants now hold this
     country. They hold, and assert in themselves, the title by which it
     was acquired. They maintain, as all others have maintained, that
     discovery gave an exclusive right to extinguish the Indian title of
     occupancy, either by purchase or by conquest; and gave also a right
     to such a degree of sovereignty, as the circumstances of the people
     would allow them to exercise. ... [This loss of native property and
     sovereignty rights was justified, the Court said, by] the character
     and religion of its inhabitants ... the superior genius of Europe
     ... [and] ample compensation to the [Indians] by bestowing on them
     civilization and Christianity, in exchange for unlimited
     independence.

Population and distribution

   [500px-Isolierte-V%C3%B6lker.png] A map of uncontacted peoples, around
   the start of the 21st century

   21st-century estimates of the population of Indigenous peoples range
   from 250 million to 750 million.^[7] In 2007, Mirjan Hirch, a
   researcher with the Center for World Indigenous Studies, estimated the
   population at 750 million to a billion, comprising six to seven
   thousand distinct peoples.^[84] The United Nations estimated in 2009
   that there were over 370 million Indigenous people living in over 90
   countries worldwide, belonging to at least 5,000 distinct
   peoples.^[85]^[86] In 2011, the World Bank estimated 300 million
   indigenous peoples, including 23 million in Latin America, 106 million
   in China, 95 million in South Asia, 30 million in Southeast Asia, 22
   million in Africa, 15 million in the Arab States and 9 million in the
   rest of the world.^[87] The International Labor Organization in 2019
   estimated, based on census data, that there were 476 million Indigenous
   people in 58 countries.^[88] Both the UN and the ILO described their
   estimates as minimums with the latter calculated using "the most
   reliable lower bound estimates available."^[89]

   As there is no universally accepted definition of Indigenous Peoples,
   their classification as such varies between countries and
   organizations.^[5] In the Americas, Australia and New Zealand,
   Indigenous status is often applied unproblematically to groups
   descended from the peoples who lived there prior to European
   settlement. However, In Asia and Africa, Indigenous status has
   sometimes been rejected by certain peoples, denied by governments or
   applied to peoples who may not be considered "Indigenous" in other
   contexts.^[90] The concept of indigenous peoples is rarely used in
   Europe, where very few indigenous groups are recognized, with the
   exception of groups such as the Sámi.^[91]

Environmental and economic benefits of the Indigenous stewardship of land

   A WRI report mentions that "tenure-secure" Indigenous lands generates
   billions and sometimes trillions of dollars' worth of benefits in the
   form of carbon sequestration, reduced pollution, clean water and more.
   It says that tenure-secure Indigenous lands have low deforestation
   rates,^[92]^[93] they help to reduce GHG emissions, control erosion and
   flooding by anchoring soil, and provide a suite of other local,
   regional and global ecosystem services. However, many of these
   communities find themselves on the front lines of the deforestation
   crisis, and their lives and livelihoods threatened.^[94]^[95]^[96]

Indigenous peoples and the environment

   Misconceptions about the historical relationship between Indigenous
   populations and their landbase has informed some Westerners view of
   California's "wild Eden", which may influence policy decisions about
   the "wilderness". Some academics assumed that the only pre-Colonial
   human interactions with nature were as "hunter-gatherers". Others say
   that the relationship was one of "calculated tempered use of nature as
   active agents of environmental change and stewardship". They argue that
   a view of "wilderness" as uninhabited nature has resulted in removal of
   Indigenous inhabitants to preserve "the wild", and that depriving the
   land of traditional Indigenous practices such as controlled burns,
   harvesting, and seed scattering has yielded dense understory shrubbery
   or tickets of young trees which are inhospitable to life. Recent
   studies indicate that Indigenous peoples used land sustainably, without
   causing substantial losses of biodiversity, for thousands of
   years.^[97]

   A goal is to ascertain an unbiased view of Indigenous practices of
   resource management.^[98]^[page needed]^[99]^[page needed]^[100]^[101]
   Historical literature, archaeological findings, ecological field
   studies, and Native Peoples' cultures show indications that Indigenous
   land management practices were largely successful in promoting habitat
   heterogeneity, increasing biodiversity, and maintaining certain
   vegetation types, sustaining human lives while conserving natural
   resources.^[102]

   Recently, it has come to light that the deforestation rate of
   Indonesian rainforests has been far greater than estimated. Such a rate
   could not have been the product of globalization as understood before;
   rather, it seemed that ordinary local people dependent on these forests
   for their livelihoods are in fact "joining distant corporations in
   creating uninhabitable landscapes."^[103]^[page needed]

   In eastern Penan, three categories of misrepresentation are noticeable:
   The Molong concept is purely a stewardship notion of resource
   management. Communities or individuals take ownership of specific
   trees, maintaining and harvesting from them sustainably over a long
   period of time. Some feel this practice has been romanticized in
   environmentalist writings. Landscape features and particularly their
   names in local languages provided geographical and historical
   information for Penan people; whereas in environmentalist accounts, it
   has turned into a spiritual practice where trees and rivers represent
   forest spirits that are sacred to the Penan people. A typical
   stereotype of some environmentalists' approach to ecological
   ethnography is to present Indigenous "knowledge" of nature as
   "valuable" to the outside world because of its hidden medicinal
   benefits. In reality, eastern Penan populations do not identify a
   medicinal stream of "knowledge". These misrepresentations in the
   "narrative" of Indigeneity and "value" of Indigenous knowledge might
   have been helpful for Penan's people in their struggle to protect their
   environment, but it might also have disastrous consequences. What
   happens if another case did not fit in this romantic narrative, or
   another Indigenous knowledge did not seem beneficial to the outside
   world. These people were being uprooted in the first place because
   their communities did not fit well with the state's system of
   values.^[104]

   At the 2024 United Nations Biodiversity Conference (COP16), Nations
   agreed to a new permanent body for Indigenous peoples, which will allow
   them to advise and offer their view at biodiversity COPs
   directly.^[105]

Indigenous peoples by region

   See also: List of Indigenous peoples

   Indigenous populations are distributed in regions throughout the globe.
   The numbers, condition and experience of Indigenous groups may vary
   widely within a given region. A comprehensive survey is further
   complicated by sometimes contentious membership and identification.

   In the postcolonial period, the concept of specific Indigenous peoples
   within the African continent has gained wider acceptance, although not
   without controversy. The highly diverse and numerous ethnic groups that
   comprise most modern, independent African states contain within them
   various peoples whose situation, cultures and pastoralist or
   hunter-gatherer lifestyles are generally marginalized and set apart
   from the dominant political and economic structures of the nation.
   Since the late 20th century these peoples have increasingly sought
   recognition of their rights as distinct Indigenous peoples, in both
   national and international contexts.

   Though the vast majority of African peoples are indigenous in the sense
   that they originate from the continent, identity as an Indigenous
   people via the modern definition of a political indigenous status is
   more restrictive, and certainly not every African ethnic group claims
   identification under these terms. Groups and communities who do claim
   this recognition are those who, by a variety of historical and
   environmental circumstances, have been placed outside of the dominant
   state systems, and whose traditional practices and land claims often
   come into conflict with the objectives and policies implemented by
   governments, companies and surrounding dominant societies.

North Africa

   The indigenous peoples of North Africa predominantly comprise the
   Berbers in the Maghreb and the Copts and Nubians in the Nile Valley.
   The vast majority of them have been Arabized after the Islamic
   conquests under the Rashidun and Umayyad caliphates.

Americas

   Nahua headdress in Yohualichan, Veracruz.

   Indigenous peoples of the Americas are broadly recognized as being
   those groups and their descendants who inhabited the region before the
   arrival of European colonizers and settlers (i.e., pre-Columbian).
   Indigenous peoples who maintain, or seek to maintain, traditional ways
   of life are found from the high Arctic north to the southern
   extremities of Tierra del Fuego.

   The impacts of historical and ongoing European colonization of the
   Americas on Indigenous communities have been in general quite severe,
   with many authorities estimating ranges of significant population
   decline primarily due to disease, land theft and violence. Several
   peoples have become extinct, or very nearly so. But there are and have
   been many thriving and resilient Indigenous nations and communities.

North America

   North America is sometimes referred to by Indigenous peoples as Abya
   Yala or Turtle Island.

   In Mexico, about 11 million people, or 9% of Mexico's total population,
   self-reported as Indigenous in 2015, making it the country with the
   highest Indigenous population in North America.^[106]^[107] In the
   southern states of Oaxaca (65.73%) and Yucatán (65.40%), the majority
   of the population is Indigenous, as reported in 2015. Other states with
   high populations of Indigenous peoples include Campeche (44.54%),
   Quintana Roo, (44.44%), Hidalgo, (36.21%), Chiapas (36.15%), Puebla
   (35.28%), and Guerrero (33.92%).^[108]^[109]

   Indigenous peoples in Canada comprise the First Nations,^[110]
   Inuit^[111] and Métis.^[112] The descriptors "Indian" and "Eskimo" have
   fallen into disuse in Canada.^[113]^[114] More currently, the term
   "Aboriginal" is being replaced with "Indigenous". Several national
   organizations in Canada changed their names from "Aboriginal" to
   "Indigenous". Most notable was the change of Aboriginal Affairs and
   Northern Development Canada (AANDC) to Indigenous and Northern Affairs
   Canada (INAC) in 2015, which then split into Indigenous Services Canada
   and Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Development Canada in
   2017.^[115] According to the 2016 Census, there are around 1,670,000
   Indigenous people in Canada.^[116] There are currently over 600
   recognized First Nations governments or bands spread across Canada,
   such as the Cree, Mohawk, Mikmaq, Blackfoot, Coast Salish, Innu, Dene
   and more, with distinctive Indigenous cultures, languages, art, and
   music.^[117]^[118] First Nations peoples signed 11 numbered
   treaties^[119] across much of what is now known as Canada between 1871
   and 1921, except in parts of British Columbia.^[citation needed]

   The Inuit have achieved a degree of administrative autonomy with the
   creation in 1999 of the territories of Nunavik (in Northern Quebec),
   Nunatsiavut (in Northern Labrador) and Nunavut, which was until 1999 a
   part of the Northwest Territories. The autonomous territory of
   Greenland within the Kingdom of Denmark is also home to a recognized
   Indigenous and majority population of Inuit (about 85%) who settled the
   area in the 13th century, displacing the Indigenous European
   Greenlandic Norse.^[120]^[121]^[122]^[123]

   In the United States, the combined populations of Native Americans,
   Inuit and other Indigenous designations totaled 2,786,652 (constituting
   about 1.5% of 2003 U.S. census figures). Some 563 scheduled tribes are
   recognized at the federal level, and a number of others recognized at
   the state level.

Central and South America

   [250px-Quechuawomanandchild.jpg] Quechua woman and child in the Sacred
   Valley, Andes, Peru

   In some countries (particularly in Latin America), Indigenous peoples
   form a sizable component of the overall national population – in
   Bolivia, they account for an estimated 56–70% of the total nation, and
   at least half of the population in Guatemala and the Andean and
   Amazonian nations of Peru. In English, Indigenous peoples are
   collectively referred to by different names that vary by region, age
   and ethnicity of speakers, with no one term being universally accepted.
   While still in use in-group, and in many names of organizations,
   "Indian" is less popular among younger people, who tend to prefer
   "Indigenous" or simply "Native", with most preferring to use the
   specific name of their tribe or Nation instead of generalities. In
   Spanish or Portuguese speaking countries, one finds the use of terms
   such as índios, pueblos indígenas, amerindios, povos nativos, povos
   indígenas, and, in Peru, Comunidades Nativas (Native Communities),
   particularly among Amazonian societies like the Urarina^[124] and
   Matsés. In Chile, there the most populous indigenous peoples are the
   Mapuche in the Center-South and the Aymaras in the North.^[125] Rapa
   Nui of Easter Island, who are a Polynesian people, are the only
   non-Amerindian indigenous people in Chile.^[citation needed]

   Indigenous peoples make up 0.4% of all Brazilian population, or about
   700,000 people.^[126] Indigenous peoples are found in the entire
   territory of Brazil, although the majority of them live in Indian
   reservations in the North and Center-Western part of the country. On 18
   January 2007, FUNAI reported that it had confirmed the presence of 67
   different uncontacted peoples in Brazil, up from 40 in 2005. With this
   addition Brazil has now overtaken the island of New Guinea as the
   country having the largest number of uncontacted peoples.^[127]

   Due to changes in the demographic history of Palestine, there are
   competing claims that Jews and Palestinian Arabs are indigenous to the

   religious connections to the land as their ancient

   pre-existing population displaced by Jewish settlement, and currently
   constituting a minority in the State of Israel.^[160]^[161] In 2007,
   the Negev Bedouin were officially recognized as Indigenous peoples of
   Israel by the United Nations.^[162] This has been criticized both by
   scholars associated with the Israeli state, who dispute the Bedouin's
   claim to indigeneity,^[163] and those who argue that recognizing just
   one group of Palestinians as indigenous risks undermining others'
   claims and "fetishizing" nomadic cultures.^[164]

   Ainu people are an ethnic group indigenous to Hokkaido, the Kuril
   Islands, and much of Sakhalin. As Japanese settlement expanded, the
   Ainu were pushed northward and fought against the Japanese in
   Shakushain's Revolt and Menashi–Kunashir Rebellion, until by the Meiji
   period they were confined by the government to a reservation near Lake
   Akan in Hokkaido.^[167] In a ground-breaking 1997 decision involving
   the Ainu people of Japan, the Japanese courts recognized their claim in
   law, stating that "If one minority group lived in an area prior to
   being ruled over by a majority group and preserved its distinct ethnic
   culture even after being ruled over by the majority group, while
   another came to live in an area ruled over by a majority after
   consenting to the majority rule, it must be recognized that it is only
   natural that the distinct ethnic culture of the former group requires
   greater consideration."^[168]

   The Dzungar Oirats are indigenous to the Dzungaria in Northern
   Xinjiang.^[citation needed]

   The languages of Taiwanese aborigines have significance in historical

   In Hong Kong, the indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories are
   defined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration as people descended
   through the male line from a person who was in 1898, before Convention
   for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory.^[172] There are several
   different groups that make up the indigenous inhabitants, the Punti,
   Hakka, Hoklo, and Tanka. All are nonetheless considered part of the
   Cantonese majority, although some like the Tanka have been shown to
   have genetic and anthropological roots in the Baiyue people, the
   pre-Han Chinese inhabitants of Southern China.^[citation needed]

   The Russians invaded Siberia and conquered the indigenous people in the
   17th–18th centuries.^[citation needed]

   Nivkh people are an ethnic group indigenous to Sakhalin, having a few
   speakers of the Nivkh language, but their fisher culture has been
   endangered due to the development of oil field of Sakhalin from
   1990s.^[173]

   In Russia, definition of "Indigenous peoples" is contested largely
   referring to a number of population (less than 50,000 people), and
   neglecting self-identification, origin from indigenous populations who
   inhabited the country or region upon invasion, colonization or
   establishment of state frontiers, distinctive social, economic and
   cultural institutions.^[174]^[175] Thus, indigenous peoples of Russia
   such as Sakha, Komi, Karelian and others are not considered as such due
   to the size of the population (more than 50,000 people), and
   consequently they "are not the subjects of the specific legal
   protections."^[176] The Russian government recognizes only 40 ethnic
   groups as indigenous peoples, even though there are 30 other groups to
   be counted as such. The reason of nonrecognition is the size of the
   population and relatively late advent to their current regions, thus
   indigenous peoples in Russia should be numbered less than 50,000
   people.^[175]^[177]^[178]^[page needed]

   The Malay Singaporeans are the Indigenous people of Singapore,
   inhabiting it since the Austronesian migration.^[citation needed] They
   had established the Kingdom of Singapura back in the 13th century. The
   name "Singapore" is an anglicisation of the Malay name Singapura which
   is derived from the Sanskrit word for 'lion city'. The native Malay
   name for the main island of Singapore is Pulau Ujong.^[citation needed]

   Dayak People are one of the Indigenous groups of Borneo. It is a loose
   term for over 200 riverine and hill-dwelling ethnic groups, located in
   Borneo, each with its own dialect, customs, laws, territory, and
   culture, although common distinguishing traits are readily
   identifiable.^[citation needed]

   The Cham are the Indigenous people of the former state of Champa which

   In Indonesia, there are 50 to 70 million people who are classified as
   Indigenous peoples by the local Indigenous rights advocacy group
   Aliansi Masyarakat Adat Nusantara.^[179] However, the Indonesian
   government does not recognize the existence of indigenous peoples,
   classifying every Native Indonesian ethnic group as "indigenous"
   despite the clear cultural distinctions of certain groups.^[180] This
   problem is shared by many other countries in the ASEAN
   region.^[citation needed]

   In the Philippines, there are 135 ethno-linguistic groups, 110 of which
   are considered as Indigenous peoples by the National Commission on
   Indigenous Peoples.^[181] The Indigenous people of Cordillera
   Administrative Region and Cagayan Valley in the Philippines are the
   Igorot people. The Indigenous peoples of Mindanao are the Lumad peoples
   and the Moro (Tausug, Maguindanao Maranao and others) who also live in
   the Sulu archipelago. There are also others sets of Indigenous peoples
   in Palawan, Mindoro, Visayas, and the rest central and south Luzon. The
   country has one of the largest Indigenous peoples population in the
   world. The recognition of the rights of Indigenous peoples was legally
   enshrined in 1997 with the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act.^[181]

   In Myanmar, indigenous peoples include the Shan, the Karen, the
   Rakhine, the Karenni, the Chin, the Kachin and the Mon. However, there

   Various ethnic groups have lived in Europe for millennia. However, the

   context.^[why?]^[183]

   Indigenous minority populations in Europe include the Sámi peoples of

   as the only recognized Indigenous peoples in Europe,^[190]^[191]^[192]
   with others describing them as the only Indigenous people in the
   European Union.^[193]

   Other groups, particularly in Central, Western and Southern Europe,
   that might be considered to fit the description of Indigenous peoples
   in the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989, such as the
   Sorbs, are generally categorized as national minorities instead.^[183]

   In Australia, the Indigenous populations are the Aboriginal Australian
   peoples (comprising many different nations and language groups) and the
   Torres Strait Islander peoples (also with sub-groups). These two groups
   are often referred to as Indigenous Australians,^[194] although terms
   such as First Nations^[195] and First Peoples are also used.^[196]

Pacific Islands

   Polynesian, Melanesian and Micronesian peoples originally populated
   many of the present-day Pacific Island countries in the Oceania region
   over the course of thousands of years. European, American, Chilean and
   Japanese colonial expansion in the Pacific brought many of these areas
   under non-Indigenous administration, mainly during the 19th century.
   During the 20th century, several of these former colonies gained
   independence and nation-states formed under local control. However,
   various peoples have put forward claims for Indigenous recognition
   where their islands are still under external administration; examples
   include the Chamorros of Guam and the Northern Marianas, and the
   Marshallese of the Marshall Islands. Some islands remain under
   administration from Paris, Washington, London or Wellington.

   The remains of at least 25 miniature humans, who lived between 1,000
   and 3,000 years ago, were recently found on the islands of Palau in
   Micronesia.^[197]

   In most parts of Oceania, Indigenous peoples outnumber the descendants
   of colonists. Exceptions include Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii. In
   New Zealand, based on various factors including census data and
   self-identification, the proportion of full or part Māori of the
   population on 30 June 2021 was estimated to be 17%.^[198] Māori
   developed from Polynesian people who settled in New Zealand after
   migrations from other Pacific islands, probably in the 13th
   century.^[199] Many leaders of Māori nations (iwi) signed a written
   agreement with the British Crown in 1840, known as the Treaty of
   Waitangi.^[200]^[201]^[202]

   A majority of the Papua New Guinea population is Indigenous, with more
   than 700 different nationalities recognized in a total population of
   8 million.^[203] The country's constitution and key statutes identify
   traditional or custom-based practices and land tenure, and explicitly
   set out to promote the viability of these traditional societies within
   the modern state. However, conflicts and disputes concerning land use
   and resource rights continue between indigenous groups, the government,
   and corporate entities.

   endorses Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People, 2010 The New
   Zealand delegation, including Māori members, endorses the United
   Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2010

   The 1989 ILO Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples mainly
   concerns non-discrimination but also covers indigenous peoples' rights
   to development, customary laws, lands, territories and resources,
   employment, education and health. By 2013, the convention had been
   ratified by 22 countries, mainly in Latin America.^[13]

   In 2007, the United Nations (UN) adopted a Declaration on the Rights of
   Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) specifying the collective rights of
   Indigenous peoples, including their rights to self-determination and to
   protect their cultures, identities, languages, ceremonies, and access
   to employment, health, education and natural resources.^[14] The
   declaration is not a formally binding treaty but some provisions might
   be considered customary international law. The declaration has been
   endorsed by at least 148 states but its provisions have not been
   consistently implemented.^[204]

   Indigenous peoples confront a diverse range of concerns associated with
   their status and interaction with other cultural groups, as well as
   changes in their inhabited environment. Some challenges are specific to
   particular groups; however, other challenges are commonly
   experienced.^[205]

   Wherever Indigenous cultural identity is asserted, common societal
   issues and concerns arise. These concerns are often not unique to
   Indigenous groups. Despite the diversity of Indigenous peoples, they
   share common problems and issues in dealing with the prevailing, or
   invading, society.^[citation needed] They are generally concerned that
   the cultures and lands of Indigenous peoples are being lost and that
   Indigenous peoples suffer both discrimination and pressure to
   assimilate into the surrounding or colonizing societies. This is borne
   out by the fact that the lands and cultures of nearly all of the
   peoples listed at the end of this article are under threat. Notable
   exceptions are the Sakha and Komi peoples (two northern Indigenous
   peoples of Russia), who now control their own autonomous republics
   within the Russian state, and the Canadian Inuit, who form a majority
   of the territory of Nunavut (created in 1999). Despite the control of
   their territories, many Sakha people have lost their lands as a result
   of the Russian Homestead Act, which allows any Russian citizen to own
   any land in the Far Eastern region of Russia.^[citation needed]

   In Australia, a landmark case, Mabo v Queensland (No 2),^[206] saw the
   High Court of Australia reject the idea of terra nullius. This
   rejection ended up recognizing that there was a pre-existing system of
   law practiced by the Meriam people.^[207]

   A 2009 United Nations publication says:^[208]

     Although indigenous peoples are often portrayed as a hindrance to
     development, their cultures and traditional knowledge are also
     increasingly seen as assets. It is argued that it is important for
     the human species as a whole to preserve as wide a range of cultural
     diversity as possible, and that the protection of indigenous
     cultures is vital to this enterprise.

Human rights violations

   [250px-Indigenous_march_right_to_self-determination.jpg] Indigenous
   peoples march for their right to self-determination in Davao City
   (2008).

   According to Samuel Totten, some governments do not respect the rights
   of Indigenous peoples.^[209] In the latter part of the twentieth
   century the genocide of Indigenous peoples in Australia and Namibia
   attracted more attention from the international community including
   scholars and human rights organizations.^[210]

   The Bangladeshi government has stated that there are "no indigenous
   peoples in Bangladesh".^[211] This statement has angered the Indigenous
   peoples of Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh, collectively known as
   the Jumma.^[212] Experts have protested against this move of the
   Bangladesh government and have questioned the government's definition
   of the term "indigenous peoples".^[213]^[214] This move by the
   Bangladesh government is seen by the Indigenous peoples of Bangladesh
   as another step by the Government to further erode their already
   limited rights.^[215]

   Hindu Chams and Muslim Chams have both experienced religious and ethnic
   persecution and restrictions on their faith under the current
   Vietnamese government, with the Vietnamese state confiscating Cham
   property and forbidding Cham from observing their religious beliefs.
   Hindu temples were turned into tourist sites against the wishes of the
   Cham Hindus. In 2010 and 2013 several incidents occurred in Thành Tín
   and Phươc Nhơn villages where Cham were murdered by Vietnamese. In
   2012, Vietnamese police in Chau Giang village stormed into a Cham
   Mosque, stole the electric generator, and also raped Cham girls.^[216]
   Cham in the Mekong Delta have also been economically marginalized, with
   ethnic Vietnamese settling on land previously owned by Cham people with
   state support.^[217]

   The Indonesian government has outright denied the existence of
   Indigenous peoples within the countries' borders. In 2012, Indonesia
   stated that 'The Government of Indonesia supports the promotion and
   protection of indigenous people worldwide ... Indonesia, however, does
   not recognize the application of the indigenous peoples concept ... in
   the country'.^[218] Along with the brutal treatment of the country's
   Papuan people (a conservative estimate places the violent deaths at
   100,000 people in West New Guinea since Indonesian occupation in 1963,
   see Papua conflict) has led to Survival International condemning
   Indonesia for treating its Indigenous peoples as the worst in the
   world.^[218]

   The Vietnamese viewed and dealt with the Indigenous Montagnards from
   the Central Highlands of Vietnam as "savages", which caused a
   Montagnard uprising against the Vietnamese.^[219] The Vietnamese were
   originally centered around the Red River Delta but engaged in conquest
   and seized new lands such as Champa, the Mekong Delta (from Cambodia)
   and the Central Highlands during Nam Tien. While the Vietnamese
   received strong Chinese influence in their culture and civilization and
   were Sinicized, and the Cambodians and Laotians were Indianized, the
   Montagnards in the Central Highlands maintained their own Indigenous
   culture without adopting external culture and were the true Indigenous
   of the region. To hinder encroachment on the Central Highlands by
   Vietnamese nationalists, the term Pays Montagnard du Sud-Indochinois
   (PMSI) emerged for the Central Highlands along with the indigenous
   being addressed by the name Montagnard.^[220] The tremendous scale of
   Vietnamese Kinh colonists flooding into the Central Highlands has
   significantly altered the demographics of the region.^[221] The
   anti-ethnic minority discriminatory policies by the Vietnamese,
   environmental degradation, deprivation of lands from the Indigenous
   people, and settlement of Indigenous lands by an overwhelming number of
   Vietnamese settlers led to massive protests and demonstrations by the
   Central Highland's indigenous ethnic minorities against the Vietnamese
   in January–February 2001. This event gave a tremendous blow to the
   claim often published by the Vietnamese government that in Vietnam
   "There has been no ethnic confrontation, no religious war, no ethnic
   conflict. And no elimination of one culture by another."^[222]

   In May 2016, the Fifteenth Session of the United Nations Permanent
   Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) affirmed that Indigenous peoples
   are distinctive groups protected in international or national
   legislation as having a set of specific rights based on their
   linguistic and historical ties to a particular territory, prior to
   later settlement, development or occupation of a region.^[223] The
   session affirms that, since Indigenous peoples are vulnerable to
   exploitation, marginalization, oppression, forced assimilation, and
   genocide by nation states formed from colonizing populations or by
   different, politically dominant ethnic groups, individuals and
   communities maintaining ways of life indigenous to their regions are
   entitled to special protection.^[citation needed]

   The Indigenous people from Tanzania's Maasai community were reportedly
   subjected to eviction from their ancestral land to make way for a
   luxury game reserve by Otterlo Business Corporation in June 2022. The
   game reserve was reportedly being set up for the royals of the United
   Arab Emirates also linked to OBC or the Otterlo Business Corporation.
   According to lawyers and human rights groups and activists,
   approximately 30 Maasai people were injured by security forces in the
   process of eviction and delimiting a land area of 1,500 km^2
   (580 sq mi). A 2019 UN report has described OBC as a 'UAE-based'
   luxury-game hunting company, granted a license to hunt by the Tanzanian
   government in 1992 for "the UAE royal family to organize private
   hunting trips", denying the Maasai people access to their own
   land.^[224]

Health issues

   In December 1993, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed the
   International Decade of the World's Indigenous People, and requested UN
   specialized agencies to consider with governments and indigenous people
   how they can contribute to the success of the Decade of Indigenous
   People, commencing in December 1994. As a consequence, the World Health
   Organization (WHO), at its Forty-seventh World Health Assembly,
   established a core advisory group of Indigenous representatives with
   special knowledge of the health needs and resources of their
   communities, thus beginning a long-term commitment to the issue of the
   health of Indigenous peoples.^[225]

   The WHO noted in 2003 that "Statistical data on the health status of
   indigenous peoples is scarce. This is especially notable for indigenous
   peoples in Africa, Asia and eastern Europe", but snapshots from various
   countries (where such statistics are available) show that indigenous
   people are in worse health than the general population, in advanced and
   developing countries alike: higher incidence of diabetes in some
   regions of Australia;^[226] higher prevalence of poor sanitation and
   lack of safe water among Twa households in Rwanda;^[227] a greater
   prevalence of childbirths without prenatal care among ethnic minorities
   in Vietnam;^[228] suicide rates among Inuit youth in Canada are eleven
   times higher than the national average;^[229] infant mortality rates
   are higher for Indigenous peoples everywhere.^[230]

   The first UN publication on the State of the World's Indigenous Peoples
   revealed alarming statistics about indigenous peoples' health. Health
   disparities between indigenous and non-indigenous populations are
   evident in both developed and developing countries. Native Americans in
   the United States are 600 times more likely to acquire tuberculosis and
   62% more likely to commit suicide than the non-Indian population.
   Tuberculosis, obesity, and type 2 diabetes are major health concerns
   for the indigenous in developed countries.^[231]^[page needed]
   Globally, health disparities touch upon nearly every health issue,
   including HIV/AIDS, cancer, malaria, cardiovascular disease,
   malnutrition, parasitic infections, and respiratory diseases, affecting
   indigenous peoples at much higher rates. Many causes of Indigenous
   children's mortality could be prevented. Poorer health conditions
   amongst indigenous peoples result from longstanding societal issues,
   such as extreme poverty and racism, but also the intentional
   marginalization and dispossession of Indigenous peoples by dominant,
   non-Indigenous populations and societal structures.^[231]

Racism and discrimination

   [250px-Mokka_and_their_house.jpg] "Savages of Mokka and Their House in
   Formosa", pre-1945, Taiwan under Japanese rule

   Indigenous peoples have frequently been subjected to various forms of
   racism and discrimination. Indigenous peoples have been denoted as
   being barbaric, primitive, savage^[232] or uncivilized. These terms
   were commonly used during the heyday of European colonial expansion,
   and they are still being used by certain societies in modern
   times.^[233]^[full citation needed]

   During the 17th century, Europeans commonly labeled Indigenous peoples
   "uncivilized". Some philosophers, such as Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679),
   considered Indigenous people mere "savages". Others (especially
   literary figures in the 18th century) popularized the concept of "noble
   savages". Those who were close to the Hobbesian view tended to believe
   that they had a duty to "civilize" and "modernize" the Indigenous.

   Survival International runs a campaign to stamp out media portrayals of
   Indigenous peoples as "primitives" or "savages".^[234]

   After World War I (1914–1918), many Europeans came to doubt the
   morality of the means which were used to "civilize" peoples. At the
   same time, the anti-colonial movement, and advocates for the rights of
   Indigenous peoples, argued that words such as "civilized" and "savage"
   were products and tools of colonialism, and they also argued that
   colonialism itself was savagely destructive. In the mid-20th century,
   European attitudes began to shift to the view that Indigenous and
   tribal peoples are the only peoples who should have the right to decide
   what should happen to their ancient cultures and their ancestral
   lands.^[235]

Cultural appropriation

   New Age and Neopagan adherents often look to the cultures of Indigenous
   peoples seeking to find ancient traditional truths and spiritual
   practices to appropriate into their lifestyles and worldviews.^[236]

Environmental injustice

   [250px-Helena_Gualinga.jpg] Helena Gualinga, an indigenous
   environmental and human rights activist^[237]

   At an international level, Indigenous peoples have received increased
   recognition of their environmental rights since 2002, but few countries
   respect these rights in reality. The UN Declaration on the Rights of
   Indigenous Peoples, adopted by the General Assembly in 2007,
   established Indigenous peoples' right to self-determination, stating
   rights to manage natural resources, and cultural and intellectual
   property. In countries where these rights are recognized, land titling
   and demarcation procedures are often put on delay, or leased out by the
   state as concessions for extractive industries without consulting
   Indigenous communities.^[231]

   Many in the United States federal government are in favor of exploiting
   oil reserves in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, where the Gwich'in
   Indigenous people rely on herds of caribou. Oil drilling could destroy
   thousands of years of culture for the Gwich'in. On the other hand, some
   of the Inupiat people, from another Indigenous community in the region,
   favor oil drilling because they could benefit economically.^[238]

   The introduction of industrial agricultural technologies such as
   fertilizers, pesticides, and large plantation schemes have destroyed
   ecosystems that Indigenous communities formerly depended on, forcing
   resettlement. Development projects such as dam construction, pipelines
   and resource extraction have displaced large numbers of Indigenous
   peoples, often without providing compensation. Governments have forced
   Indigenous peoples off of their ancestral lands in the name of
   ecotourism and national park development. Indigenous women are
   especially affected by land dispossession because they must walk longer
   distances for water and fuel wood. These women also become economically
   dependent on men when they lose their livelihoods. Indigenous groups
   asserting their rights has most often resulted in torture,
   imprisonment, or death.^[231]

   The building of dams can hurt Indigenous peoples by hurting the
   ecosystems that provide them water, food. For example, the Munduruku
   people in the Amazon rainforest are opposing the building of Tapajós
   dam^[239] with the help of Greenpeace.^[240]

   Most Indigenous populations are already subject to the deleterious
   effects of climate change. Climate change has not only environmental,
   but also human rights and socioeconomic implications for Indigenous
   communities. The World Bank acknowledges climate change as an obstacle
   to Millennium Development Goals, notably the fight against poverty,
   disease, and child mortality, in addition to environmental
   sustainability.^[231]

Use of indigenous knowledge

   Main article: Traditional knowledge

   [330px-College_of_DuPage_Celebrates_Native_American_Culture_2020_54.jpg
   ] Native American dancer of the Save Our Ancestors Remains and
   Resources Indigenous Network Group (SOARRING) Foundation, a
   not-for-profit organization whose mission is to educate people about
   Indigenous ways of life

   Indigenous knowledge is considered as very important for issues linked
   with sustainability.^[241]^[242] Indigenous peoples play an essential
   role in conserving biodiversity around the world. An oft-cited
   statistic is that Indigenous peoples steward lands which comprise 80%
   of the world's biodiversity. In 2024, Fernández-Llamazares et al.
   investigated the origin of this claim in Nature and found that it is
   without basis, also stating that "biodiversity" is broad and not
   precisely definable, and that the claim may do more harm than good.
   With a specific description, such as "natural lands" (that being lands
   with low levels of ecological disturbance), it can be said that at
   least 37% of remaining natural lands fall within the territories of
   Indigenous peoples. Fernández-Llamazares et al. state that the 80%
   claim "could undermine these and other rigorous studies — as well as
   effective efforts to conserve biodiversity by Indigenous Peoples on the
   ground".^[243]

   The Western and Eastern Penan people are two major groups of Indigenous
   populations in Malaysia. The Eastern Penan are famous for their
   resistance to loggers threatening their natural resources, specifically
   Sago palms and various fruit bearing trees. Because of the Penan's
   international fame, environmentalists often visited the area to
   document such happenings and learn more about and from the people
   there, including their perspective on the land's invasion.^[244]

   Environmentalists such as Davis and Henley, who Brosius writes lumped
   all native groups of Malaysia into one homogeneous group with the same
   ideas and traditions, and lacked dialectical connections needed to
   deeply understand the Penan, lacked full knowledge of the situation's
   specific weight to the Indigenous peoples.^[245] The two embarked on a
   mission, stating they wished to help with conservation of the Penan's
   land resources, but Brosious states they were among the many who
   repackaged traditional knowledge into something that fit a Western
   narrative and agenda, and that Davis and Henley romanticized and
   misconstrued the traditional Penan concept of molong (meaning: "to
   preserve" – the Penan marked trees for personal use and to preserve
   them for future harvesting of fruits or for materials).^[245]

   Another common occurrence is to extend Indigenous knowledge beyond its
   limits and into unrelated meanings that western consumers find
   spiritually profound. This tendency of journalists extends beyond Davis
   and Henley. It serves non-Natives to add a narrative and value beyond
   that which already exists within the knowledge base of Indigenous
   peoples. Not only do these fictionalized accounts of some Indigenous
   knowledge and traditions skew the beliefs of onlookers, but they also
   contribute to cultural genocide as the actual spiritual and religious
   beliefs of the Indigenous people are disappeared and replaced with the
   westernized fiction.^[245]
