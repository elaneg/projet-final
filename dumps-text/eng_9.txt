   Experience of a person moving to a different cultural environment
   For other uses, see Culture shock (disambiguation).

   Culture shock is an experience a person may have when one moves to a
   cultural environment which is different from one's own; it is also the
   personal disorientation a person may feel when experiencing an
   unfamiliar way of life due to immigration or a visit to a new country,
   a move between social environments, or simply transition to another
   type of life.^[1] One of the most common causes of culture shock
   involves individuals in a foreign environment. Culture shock can be
   described as consisting of at least one of four distinct phases:
   honeymoon, negotiation, adjustment, and adaptation.

   Common problems include: information overload, language barrier,
   generation gap, technology gap, skill interdependence, formulation
   dependency, homesickness (cultural), boredom (job dependency),
   ethnicity, race, skin color, response ability (cultural skill set).^[2]
   There is no true way to entirely prevent culture shock, as individuals
   in any society are personally affected by cultural contrasts
   differently.^[3]

   Culture shock is often experienced by students who participate in study
   abroad programs. Research considering the study abroad experiences
   states that in-country support for students may assist them in
   overcoming the challenges and phases of culture shock. As stated in a
   study by Young et al., "...the distress experienced by culture shock
   has long-lasting effects therefore, universities with well-rounded
   programs that support students throughout the study abroad program,
   including preparation and post-program assistance, can alleviate
   challenges posed by culture shock, allow for global development and
   assist with the transition back into the home culture."^[4]

Oberg's four phases model

   [edit]
   [330px-Acculturation_curve_and_culture_shock.svg.png] According to
   acculturation model, people will initially have (1) a honeymoon period,
   followed by (2) a transition period, that is, cultural shock. Over time
   people will begin to (3) adapt (the dotted line depicted some people
   hated by new cultures instead^[clarification needed]), before in some
   cases (4) returning to their own places and re-adapting to the old
   culture.

   Kalervo Oberg first proposed his model of cultural adjustment in a talk
   to the Women's Club of Rio de Janeiro in 1954.^[5]^[6]^[self-published
   source]^[7]

Honeymoon

   [edit]

   During this period, the differences between the old and new culture are
   seen in a romantic light. For example, in moving to a new country, an
   individual might love the new food, the pace of life, and the locals'
   habits. During the first few weeks, most people are fascinated by the
   new culture. They associate with nationals who speak their language,
   and who are polite to the foreigners. Like most honeymoon periods, this
   stage eventually ends.^[8]

Negotiation

   [edit]

   After some time (usually around three months, depending on the
   individual), differences between the old and new culture become
   apparent and may create anxiety. Excitement may eventually give way to
   unpleasant feelings of frustration and anger as one continues to
   experience unfavorable events that may be perceived as strange and
   offensive to one's cultural attitude. Language barriers, stark
   differences in public hygiene, traffic safety, food accessibility and
   quality may heighten the sense of disconnection from the
   surroundings.^[9]

   While being transferred into a different environment puts special
   pressure on communication skills, there are practical difficulties to
   overcome, such as circadian rhythm disruption that often leads to
   insomnia and daylight drowsiness; adaptation of gut flora to different
   bacteria levels and concentrations in food and water; difficulty in
   seeking treatment for illness, as medicines may have different names
   from the native country's and the same active ingredients might be hard
   to recognize.

   Still, the most important change in the period is communication: People
   adjusting to a new culture often feel lonely and homesick because they
   are not yet used to the new environment and meet people with whom they
   are not familiar every day. The language barrier may become a major
   obstacle in creating new relationships: special attention must be paid
   to one's and others' culture-specific body language signs, linguistic
   faux pas, conversation tone, linguistic nuances and customs, and false
   friends. Such cultural adjustments may also cause a sense of identity
   confusion as individuals try to balance their original cultural
   identity with the pressures of assimilating into a new one. Having to
   preserve one's identity while adhering to new standards may be
   psychologically taxing, which can result in emotional tiredness or even
   despair.^[10]

   In the case of students studying abroad, some develop additional
   symptoms of loneliness that ultimately affect their lifestyles as a
   whole. Due to the strain of living in a different country without
   parental support, international students often feel anxious and feel
   more pressure while adjusting to new cultures—even more so when the
   cultural distances are wide, as patterns of logic and speech are
   different and a special emphasis is put on rhetoric.

Adjustment

   [edit]

   Again, after some time (usually 6 to 12 months), one grows accustomed
   to the new culture and develops routines. One knows what to expect in
   most situations and the host country no longer feels all that new. One
   becomes concerned with basic living again, and things become more
   "normal". One starts to develop problem-solving skills for dealing with
   the culture and begins to accept the culture's ways with a positive
   attitude. The culture begins to make sense, and negative reactions and
   responses to the culture are reduced.^[11]

Adaptation

   [edit]

   In the mastery stage individuals are able to participate fully and
   comfortably in the host culture. Mastery does not mean total
   conversion; people often keep many traits from their earlier culture,
   such as accents and languages. It is often referred to as the
   bicultural stage.

Development

   [edit]

   Gary R. Weaver wrote that culture shock has "three basic causal
   explanations": loss of familiar cues, the breakdown of interpersonal
   communications, and an identity crisis.^[12] Peter S. Adler emphasized
   the psychological causes.^[13] Tema Milstein wrote that it can have
   positive effects.^[14]

Reverse culture shock

   [edit]

   Reverse culture shock (also known as "re-entry shock" or "own culture
   shock"^[15]) may take place—returning to one's home culture after
   growing accustomed to a new one can produce the same effects as
   described above.^[16]^[17] These are results from the psychosomatic and
   psychological consequences of the readjustment process to the primary
   culture.^[18] The affected person often finds this more surprising and
   difficult to deal with than the original culture shock. This
   phenomenon, the reactions that members of the re-entered culture
   exhibit toward the re-entrant, and the inevitability of the two are
   encapsulated in the following saying, also the title of a book by
   Thomas Wolfe: You Can't Go Home Again.

   Reverse culture shock is generally made up of two parts: idealization
   and expectations. When an extended period of time is spent abroad,
   humans have a tendency to focus on the good from their past over the
   bad and create an idealization. Secondly, once removed from our
   familiar setting and placed in a foreign one, humans are biased towards
   incorrectly assuming that their previous world has not changed. The
   realization that life back home is now different, that the world has
   continued on, and the process of readjusting to these new conditions as
   well as actualizing new perceptions about the world with an old way of
   living causes discomfort and psychological
   anguish.^[19]^[self-published source?]

Outcomes

   [edit]

   There are three basic outcomes of the adjustment phase:^[20]
     * Some people find it impossible to accept the foreign culture and to
       integrate. They isolate themselves from the host country's
       environment, which they come to perceive as hostile, withdraw into
       an (often mental) "ghetto" and see return to their own culture as
       the only way out. This group is sometimes known as "Rejectors" and
       describes approximately 60% of expatriates.^[21] These "Rejectors"
       also have the greatest problems re-integrating back home after
       return.^[22]^[failed verification]
     * Some people integrate fully and take on all parts of the host
       culture while losing their original identity. This is called
       cultural assimilation. They normally remain in the host country
       forever. This group is sometimes known as "Adopters" and describes
       approximately 10% of immigrants.^[21]
     * Some people manage to adapt to the aspects of the host culture they
       see as positive, while keeping some of their own and creating their
       unique blend. They have no major problems returning home or
       relocating elsewhere. This group can be thought to be cosmopolitan.
       Approximately 30% of immigrants belong to this group.^[21]

   Culture shock has many different effects, time spans, and degrees of
   severity.^[23] Many people are hampered by its presence and do not
   recognize why they are bothered.^[24]

   There is evidence to suggest that the psychological influence of
   culture shock might also have physiological implications. For example,
   the psycho-social stress experienced during these circumstances is
   correlated with an early onset of puberty.^[25]

Transition shock

   [edit]
   [330px-Japanese_woman_does_double-take_at_foreigner.jpg] A local woman
   does a double-take at a foreigner during the evening rush hour in
   Japan.

   Culture shock is a subcategory of a more universal construct called
   transition shock. Transition shock is a state of loss and
   disorientation predicated by a change in one's familiar environment
   that requires adjustment. There are many symptoms of transition shock,
   including:^[26]
     * Anger
     * Boredom
     * Compulsive eating/drinking/weight gain
     * Desire for home and old friends
     * Excessive concern over cleanliness
     * Excessive sleep or trouble falling asleep^[27]^[28]
     * Feelings of helplessness and withdrawal
     * Getting "stuck" on one thing
     * Glazed stare
     * Homesickness
     * Hostility towards host nationals
     * Impulsivity
     * Irritability
     * Mood swings
     * Physiological stress reactions
     * Stereotyping host nationals
     * Suicidal or fatalistic thoughts
     * Withdrawal
