   Growth of tissues or cells in an artificial medium separate from the
   parent organism
   [250px-Tissue_culture_vials_nci-vol-2142-300.jpg] Flasks containing

   Tissue culture is the growth of tissues or cells in an artificial
   medium separate from the parent organism. This technique is also called
   micropropagation. This is typically facilitated via use of a liquid,
   semi-solid, or solid growth medium, such as broth or agar. Tissue
   culture commonly refers to the culture of animal cells and tissues,
   with the more specific term plant tissue culture being used for plants.
   The term "tissue culture" was coined by American pathologist Montrose
   Thomas Burrows.^[1]

Historical use

   [edit]

   In 1885 Wilhelm Roux removed a section of the medullary plate of an
   embryonic chicken and maintained it in a warm saline solution for
   several days, establishing the basic principle of tissue culture. In
   1907 the zoologist Ross Granville Harrison demonstrated the growth of
   frog embryonic cells that would give rise to nerve cells in a medium of
   clotted lymph. In 1913, E. Steinhardt, C. Israeli, and R. A. Lambert
   grew vaccinia virus in fragments of guinea pig corneal tissue.^[2] In
   1996, the first use of regenerative tissue was used to replace a small
   length of urethra, which led to the understanding that the technique of
   obtaining samples of tissue, growing it outside the body without a
   scaffold, and reapplying it, can be used for only small distances of
   less than 1 cm.^[3]

   Gottlieb Haberlandt first pointed out the possibilities of the culture
   of isolated tissues, plant tissue culture.^[4] He suggested that the
   potentialities of individual cells via tissue culture as well as that
   the reciprocal influences of tissues on one another could be determined
   by this method. Since Haberlandt's original assertions, methods for
   tissue and cell culture have been realized, leading to significant
   discoveries in biology and medicine. His original idea, presented in
   1902, was called totipotentiality: "Theoretically all plant cells are
   able to give rise to a complete plant."^[5]^[6]^[7]

Modern usage

   [edit]
   Main article: Cell culture
   [250px-Cho_cells_adherend2.jpg] Cultured cells growing in growth medium

   In modern usage, "Tissue culture" generally refers to the growth of
   cells from a multicellular organism in vitro. These cells may be cells
   isolated from a donor organism (primary cells) or an immortalised cell
   line. The cells are bathed in a culture medium, which contains
   essential nutrients and energy sources necessary for the cells'
   survival.^[8] Thus, in its broader sense, "tissue culture" is often
   used interchangeably with "cell culture". On the other hand, the strict
   meaning of "tissue culture" refers to the culturing of tissue pieces,
   i.e. explant culture.

   Tissue culture is an important tool for the study of the biology of
   cells from multicellular organisms. It provides an in vitro model of
   the tissue in a well defined environment which can be easily
   manipulated and analysed. In animal tissue culture, cells may be grown
   as two-dimensional monolayers (conventional culture) or within fibrous
   scaffolds or gels to attain more naturalistic three-dimensional
   tissue-like structures (3D culture). Eric Simon, in a 1988 NIH SBIR
   grant report, showed that electrospinning could be used to produce
   nano- and submicron-scale polymeric fibrous scaffolds specifically
   intended for use as in vitro cell and tissue substrates. This early use
   of electrospun fibrous lattices for cell culture and tissue engineering
   showed that various cell types would adhere to and proliferate upon
   polycarbonate fibers. It was noted that as opposed to the flattened
   morphology typically seen in 2D culture, cells grown on the electrospun
   fibers exhibited a more rounded 3-dimensional morphology generally
   observed of tissues in vivo.^[9]

   Plant tissue culture in particular is concerned with the growing of
   entire plants from small pieces of plant tissue, cultured in
   medium.^[10] The technique of plant tissue culture, i.e., culturing
   plant cells or tissues in artificial medium supplemented with required
   nutrients, has many applications in efficient clonal propagation (true
   to the type or similar) which may be difficult via conventional
   breeding methods. Tissue culture is used in creating genetically
   modified plants, as it allows scientists to introduce DNA changes to
   plant tissue via Agrobacterium tumefaciens or a gene gun and then
   generate a full plant from these modified cells.^[11]

   Tissue cultures are commonly used in plant propagation.^[12]^[13] The
   advantage of such vegetative propagation is that it obtains a large
   amount of homogeneous material, which is of great importance in the
   propagation of valuable cultivars of ornamental plants,^[13] and
   rootstocks for fruit trees. In addition, fruit plants or flowers can be
   obtained free of viruses, phytoplasmas, viroids.^[14]

   Because plant cells are totipotent, adding growth hormones to the media
   can trigger the callus cells to develop roots, shoots and entire
   plants.^[15]

Animal tissue culture

   [edit]

   There are three common methods to establish cell culture from animals.
   The first is organ culture where whole organs from embryos or partial
   adult organs are used to initiate the organ culture in vitro. These
   cells retain their differentiated character and functional activity in
   organ culture. The second method is primary explant culture, in which
   fragments derived from animal tissue are attached to a surface using an
   extracellular matrix component (ECM), such as collagen or a plasma
   clot. This culture is known as a primary explant, and migrating cells
   are known as outgrowth. This has been used to analyze the growth
   characteristics of cancer cells in comparison to their normal
   counterparts.^[16] The third method is cell culture, of which there are
   three types: (1) precursor cell culture, i.e. undifferentiated cells
   that are to be differentiate, (2) differentiated cell culture, i.e.
   completely differentiated cells that have lost the capacity to further
   differentiate, and (3) stem cell culture, i.e. undifferentiated cells
   that can develop into any kind of cell."^[16]

Applications of animal cell culture

   [edit]

   Animal cell culture is used for many research purposes and commercial
   business also as:
     * Vaccine production
     * Monoclonal antibody production
     * Enzymes and hormones production
     * In vitro skin and other tissues and organs by stem culturing
     * Viral cultivation^[17]

Establishing a cell line

   [edit]

   A cell line can be defined as a permanently established cell culture
   which will propagate forever. Investigators mostly get cell lines from
   other investigators or from cell banks (such as the American Type
   Culture Collection), because its much easier than creating new one. In
   special cases, investigators are obligated to establish a cell line. To
   do this you must use one of the following cells:

   Transformed cell lines, Tumor tissue or Transforming normal cell in
   vitro^[17]

Subculture

   [edit]

   Subculture is the transfer of cells from one culture to start a new
   one. During this process the proliferating cells are subdivided, to
   form new cell lines.^[18]

Stem cell technology

   [edit]

   The most advanced tissue culture science is now focused on stem cells,
   stem cells can be used for tissue replacement or either organs. stem
   cell is a primitive type of cell which has the ability to differentiate
   to all the 220 cell types found in human body. Stem cells can be
   obtained from blood, brain, or muscle tissue but the most important one
   is from early embryos which has the capability to differentiate to any
   other cell.^[17]
