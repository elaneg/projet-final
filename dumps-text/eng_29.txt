   A dominant culture is a cultural practice within a particular
   political, social or economic entity, in which multiple cultures
   co-exist. It may refer to a language, religion or ritual practices,
   social value and/or social custom. These features are often a norm for
   an entire society. An individual achieves dominance by being perceived
   as belonging to that majority culture, which has a significant presence
   in institutions related to communication, education, artistic
   expression, law, government and business.^[1] The concept of "dominant
   culture" is generally used in academic discourse in communication,
   sociology, anthropology and cultural studies.^[2]

   In a society, culture is established and directed by the individuals
   with most power (hegemony).^[3] In a culture, a group of people that
   have the ability to hold power over social institutions and influence
   the rest of the society's beliefs and actions is considered dominant. A
   dominant culture is established in a society by a group of individuals
   that direct the ruling ideas, values, and beliefs that become the
   dominant worldview of a society. Individuals from the dominant culture
   spread their dominant ideologies through institutions such as
   education, religion, and politics. A dominant culture makes use of
   media and laws to spread their ideologies as well.^[4] Furthermore, a
   dominant culture can be promoted deliberately and by the suppression of
   minority cultures or subcultures.^[1]

   The culture that is dominant within a particular geopolitical entity
   can change over time in response to internal or external factors, but
   one is usually very resilient. Antonio Gramsci has written that the
   masses are in the grip of a monolithic ruling class.^[citation needed]
   However, the overall picture that Gramsci provides is not a static,
   closed system of ruling-class domination. Rather, he states that a
   society is in constant process, where the creation of
   counter-hegemonies remains a live option.^[1]

   The concept of a dominant culture, or the concept of hegemony,
   originated in Ancient Greece. Although Vladimir Lenin, a politician and
   a political theorist, defined the concept as “Domination,” Gramsci
   redefined it as “An intellectual and moral leadership directed by
   contradictory political and, cultural agents and organizations.”^[This
   quote needs a citation] He called these organizations “organic and
   traditional intellectuals” which represented the interest of the
   working class.^[5]

Examples of dominant cultures

   [edit]

   This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (May 2024)

United States

   [edit]

   In the United States, for example, a distinction is often made between
   the indigenous culture of Native Americans, and a dominant culture that
   may be described as "WASP", "Anglo", "white", "middle class", and so
   on. Some Native Americans are seen as being part of the culture of
   their own tribe, community, or family, while simultaneously
   participating in the dominant culture of America as a whole.^[6] Also,
   ethnic groups are said to exist in the United States in relation to a
   dominant culture, generally seen as English-speaking, of European
   ancestry, and Protestant Christian faith. Asian Americans,^[7]
   Jews,^[8]^[9] African Americans,^[10] Latinos,^[11] and Deaf
   people,^[12]^[13] among others, are seen as facing a choice to oppose,
   be opposed by, assimilate into, acculturate (i.e. exist alongside), or
   otherwise react to the dominant culture.

Interactions between dominant culture and co-culture

   [edit]

   Co-culture consists of minority groups, or groups whose beliefs and
   values differ from the dominant culture.^[14] In the United States,
   minority groups such as LGBTQ+, women, and black or African American
   members, for example, can experience negative effects resulting from
   their interaction with the dominant culture.^[15]^[16] Minority groups
   can be victims of stress produced by the dominant culture. Minority
   stress can be described as the product that results from the
   differences between the minority and dominant values. Furthermore,
   minority stress is the outcome of the conflict that minority group
   members experience with their social environment.^[17]

LGBTQ+ Community

   [edit]

   Members from the LGBTQ+ community, that live in a heterosexist society,
   are susceptible and inclined to suffer from chronic stress due to their
   stigmatization. Minority stressors include internalized homophobia,
   stigma and experiences of violence and discrimination.^[15]
   Internalized homophobia can be described as an LGBTQ+ member's
   disposition to societal negative attitudes towards the self while
   stigma refers to an LGBTQ+ member's expectation of discrimination and
   rejection.^[17]

Women

   [edit]

   Women, as many other co-culture groups, are greatly affected by the
   dominant culture that surround them. The dominant culture tend to
   perceive women as less worthy of economic and educational
   opportunities.^[18] Also, in many cultures, women are expected to
   behave in a certain way and be responsible for tasks that men are not
   as they are also subject to double standards.^[19] These interactions
   can lead to unfavorable and negative effects on women. For example,
   women can feel restricted from expressing freely, fighting for their
   aspirations, and trying new activities.^[20]

Black and African American community

   [edit]
   This article may be confusing or unclear to readers. Please help
   clarify the article. There might be a discussion about this on the talk
   page. (October 2023) (Learn how and when to remove this message)

   Globally,^[where?] black or African American communities have been
   affected by the dominant cultures. In different countries, in order for
   black people to incorporate into the cultural hegemony, they were
   frequently isolated from their own cultural group, or an attempt was
   made to eradicate their culture completely. Many examples of cultural
   alienation and annihilation can be found across black and African
   American communities.^[21]^[22]
