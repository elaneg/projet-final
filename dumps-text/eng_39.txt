   DCMS originates from the Department of National Heritage (DNH), which
   itself was created on 11 April 1992 out of various other departments,
   soon after the Conservative election victory. The former ministers for
   the Arts and for Sport (both created in 1964) had previously been
   located in other departments.

   DNH was renamed as the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS)
   on 14 July 1997, under the premiership of Tony Blair. It was renamed to
   Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport on 3 July 2017,
   staying DCMS under the premiership of Theresa May to reflect the
   department's increased activity in the digital sector.^[4] The
   department was renamed back to the Department for Culture, Media and
   Sport (DCMS) in February 2023, with responsibility for digital moving
   to the new Department for Science, Innovation and Technology.

2012 Olympics

   [edit]

   DCMS was the co-ordinating department for the successful bid by London
   to host the 2012 Olympics and appointed and oversees the agencies
   delivering the Games' infrastructure and programme, principally the
   Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) and LOCOG.

   The June 2007 Cabinet reshuffle led to Tessa Jowell MP taking on the
   role of Paymaster General and then Minister for the Cabinet Office
   while remaining Minister for the Olympics. Ministerial responsibility
   for the Olympics was shared with Ms Jowell in the Cabinet Office, but
   the staff of the Government Olympic Executive (GOE) remained based in
   DCMS.

2010–2022

   [edit]

   Following the 2010 general election, ministerial responsibility for the
   Olympics returned to the Secretary of State. Although Jeremy Hunt's
   full title was Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and
   Sport, the department's name remained unchanged. On 4 September 2012,
   Hunt was appointed Health Secretary in a cabinet reshuffle and replaced
   by Maria Miller. Maria Miller later resigned due to controversy over
   her expenses. Her replacement was announced later that day as Sajid
   Javid.

   After the 2015 general election, John Whittingdale was appointed as
   Secretary of State, tasked with initiating the BBC Charter review
   process. DCMS received full responsibility for the digital economy
   policy, formerly jointly held with BIS, and sponsorship of the
   Information Commissioner's Office from the Ministry of Justice.

   Whittingdale was replaced by Karen Bradley after the referendum on the
   UK's membership of the EU in July 2016. The Office for Civil Society
   moved from the Cabinet Office to DCMS as part of the same reshuffle.

   In January 2018, Matt Hancock, previous Minister of State for Digital,
   was appointed Secretary of State as part of a Cabinet reshuffle. In the
   9 July 2018 reshuffle, Jeremy Wright became the Secretary of State.
   Nicky Morgan became Secretary of State in July 2019; she stood down as
   an MP at the 2019 United Kingdom general election but was ennobled as
   Baroness Morgan of Cotes and retained her position from within the
   House of Lords. As part of the 13 February 2020 reshuffle, Oliver
   Dowden MP was appointed Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media
   and Sport. Nadine Dorries succeeded on 15 September 2021. In July 2022,
   Dorries personally granted Grade II-listed status to a plaque of Cecil
   Rhodes which she believed is of "special historic interest".^[5] This
   decision attracted controversy. On 5 September 2022, in anticipation of
   the appointment of Liz Truss as Prime Minister, Dorries tendered her
   resignation as culture secretary.

Other responsibilities

   [edit]

   Other responsibilities of DCMS include listing of historic buildings,
   scheduling of ancient monuments, export licensing of cultural goods,
   and management of the Government Art Collection (GAC).

   The Secretary of State has responsibility for the maintenance of the
   land and buildings making up the historic Royal Estate under the Crown
   Lands Act 1851. These inherited functions, which were once centralised
   in the Office of Works, are now delivered as follows:
     * The Royal Parks are maintained by an executive agency within DCMS,
       the Royal Parks Agency;
     * The unoccupied royal palaces in England are managed by a contract
       with Historic Royal Palaces;
     * Maintenance of the occupied royal palaces in England was funded by
       an annual grant-in-aid to the Royal Household until 31 March 2012.
       The Secretary of State for Culture retains legal responsibility for
       these palaces, but from 1 April 2012 this funding was amalgamated
       with the Civil List into a single Sovereign Grant administered by
       HM Treasury. DCMS continues to make a separate small grant to the
       Royal Household for the maintenance of Marlborough House

   The department also has responsibility for state ceremonial occasions
   and royal funerals. However, responsibility for the Civil List element
   of head-of-state expenditure and income from the separate Crown Estate
   remains with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

   DCMS works jointly with the Department for Business, Innovation and
   Skills (BIS) on design issues, including sponsorship of the Design
   Council, and on relations with the computer games and publishing
   industries.

   DCMS works with local community system providers in broadcasting
   service via TV and Internet channels. In September 2022, it managed to
   hold a home office visit activity for media and data security knowledge
   sharing across different government departments.

   DCMS organises the annual Remembrance Day Ceremony at the Cenotaph and
   has responsibility for providing humanitarian assistance in the event
   of a disaster. In the government's response to the 7 July 2005 London
   bombings the department coordinated humanitarian support to the
   relatives of victims and arranged the memorial events.

   DCMS has also supported cyber initiatives^[6] such as Cyber Discovery
   and the UK Cyber Security Forum^[7] to support innovation in the cyber
   industry.

   The DCMS sponsors a wide range of organisations. It has policy
   responsibility for three statutory corporations and two public
   broadcasting authorities. These bodies and their operation are largely
   independent of government policy influence.

   The DCMS sponsors the following executive non-departmental public
   bodies including a number of museums and galleries:
     * Arts Council England
     * British Film Institute
     * British Library
     * British Museum
     * Gambling Commission

     * Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of
       Cultural Interest

   sector:^[9]

   DCMS is also the major financial sponsor of the following bodies, which
   are not classed as part of the UK central government:
     * Chatham Historic Dockyard Trust
     * Greenwich Foundation for the Old Royal Naval College for the Old
       Royal Naval College
     * Tyne and Wear Museums

   A National Audit Office report published in 2005 estimated that the
   department and its wide range of sponsored organisations collectively
   spent about £575 million each year purchasing goods and services. The
   report recommended better co-ordination and aggregation in planning how
   this public money was spent so as to promote its more efficient
   use.^[10]

   Sponsorship of the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the
   Arts (NESTA) transferred to the Department for Innovation, Universities
   and Skills in June 2007. The Museum of London transferred to the
   Greater London Authority on 1 April 2008.

   DCMS formerly sponsored eight Regional Cultural Consortiums with NDPB
   status. In July 2008, DCMS announced that the consortiums would be
   phased out over a twelve-month period and replaced by a new alliance of
   the regional teams of Arts Council England, Sport England, English
   Heritage and the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA).
