   Signature
   Eric Blair ("George Orwell")

   Eric Arthur Blair (25 June 1903 – 21 January 1950) was an English
   novelist, poet, essayist, journalist, and critic who wrote under the
   pen name of George Orwell. His work is characterised by lucid prose,
   social criticism, opposition to all totalitarianism (both authoritarian
   communism and fascism), and support of democratic socialism.^[2]^[3]

   Orwell is best known for his allegorical novella Animal Farm (1945) and
   the dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), although his works
   also encompass literary criticism, poetry, fiction and polemical
   journalism. His non-fiction works, including The Road to Wigan Pier
   (1937), documenting his experience of working-class life in industrial
   Northern England, and Homage to Catalonia (1938), an account of his
   experiences soldiering for the Republican faction of the Spanish Civil
   War (1936–1939), are as critically respected as his essays on politics,
   literature, language and culture.

   Orwell's work remains influential in popular culture and in political
   culture, and the adjective "Orwellian"—describing totalitarian and
   authoritarian social practices—is part of the English language, like
   many of his neologisms, such as "Big Brother", "Thought Police", "Room
   101", "Newspeak", "memory hole", "doublethink", and
   "thoughtcrime".^[4]^[5] In 2008, The Times named Orwell the
   second-greatest British writer since 1945.^[6]

Biography

Early years

   [250px-Birth-Place-George-Orwell-Motihari.jpg] Orwell's birthplace in
   Motihari, Bihar, India

   Eric Arthur Blair was born on 25 June 1903 in Motihari, Bengal
   Presidency (now Bihar), British India, into what he described as a
   "lower-upper-middle class" family.^[7]^[8] His great-great-grandfather
   Charles Blair was a wealthy slave-owning country gentleman and absentee
   owner of two Jamaican plantations;^[9] hailing from Dorset, he married
   Lady Mary Fane, daughter of Thomas Fane, 8th Earl of Westmorland.^[10]
   His grandfather Thomas Richard Arthur Blair was an Anglican
   clergyman.^[11]

   Orwell's father was Richard Walmesley Blair, who worked as a Sub-Deputy
   Opium Agent in the Opium Department of the Indian Civil Service,
   overseeing the production and storage of opium for sale to China.^[11]
   Orwell's mother, Ida Mabel Blair (née Limouzin), grew up in Moulmein,
   Burma, where her French father was involved in speculative
   ventures.^[10] Eric had two sisters: Marjorie, five years older; and
   Avril, five years younger. When Eric was one year old, his mother took
   him and Marjorie to England.^[12]^[n 1] In 2014 restoration work began
   on Orwell's birthplace and ancestral house in Motihari.^[13]
   The Blair family home at Shiplake, Oxfordshire

   In 1904, Ida settled with her children at Henley-on-Thames in
   Oxfordshire. Eric was brought up in the company of his mother and
   sisters and, apart from a brief visit in mid-1907,^[14] he did not see
   his father until 1912.^[11] Aged five, Eric was sent as a day student
   to a convent school in Henley-on-Thames. It was a Catholic convent run
   by French Ursuline nuns.^[15] His mother wanted him to have a public
   school education, but his family could not afford it. Through the
   social connections of Ida's brother Charles Limouzin, Blair gained a
   scholarship to St Cyprian's School in Eastbourne, East Sussex.^[11]

   Arriving in September 1911, he boarded for the next five years,
   returning home only for holidays. Although he knew nothing of the
   reduced fees, he "soon recognised that he was from a poorer home".^[16]
   Blair hated the school^[17] and many years later wrote an essay "Such,
   Such Were the Joys", published posthumously, based on his time there.
   At St Cyprian's, Blair first met Cyril Connolly, who became a writer
   and who, as the editor of Horizon, published several of Orwell's
   essays.^[18]

   [250px-StCyprians.JPG]
   Blair's time at St Cyprian's School inspired his essay "Such, Such Were
   the Joys".
   [250px-Seven_Sisters_3.jpg]
   The essay recounts Blair hiking across the South Downs and bathing
   among the boulders at Beachy Head on the south coast of England.^[19]

   Before the First World War, the family moved two miles (three
   kilometres) south to Shiplake, Oxfordshire, where Eric became friendly
   with the Buddicom family, especially their daughter Jacintha. When they
   first met, he was standing on his head in a field. Asked why, he said,
   "You are noticed more if you stand on your head than if you are right
   way up."^[20] Growing up together, Buddicom and Blair became idealistic
   adolescent sweethearts, reading and writing poetry together, and
   dreaming of becoming famous writers.^[21] Blair also enjoyed shooting,
   fishing and birdwatching with Jacintha's brother and sister.^[20]

   While at St Cyprian's, Blair wrote two poems that were published in the
   Henley and South Oxfordshire Standard.^[22]^[23] He came second to
   Connolly in the Harrow History Prize, had his work praised by the
   school's external examiner, and earned scholarships to Wellington and
   Eton. But inclusion on the Eton scholarship roll did not guarantee a
   place, and none was immediately available. He chose to stay at St
   Cyprian's until December 1916, in case a place at Eton became
   available.^[11]
   [250px-Awake%21_Young_Men_of_England.jpg] First World War poem by
   11-year-old Blair, "Awake! Young Men of England", published in 1914 in
   the Henley and South Oxfordshire Standard

   In January, Blair took up the place at Wellington, where he spent the
   Spring term. In May 1917 a place became available as a King's Scholar
   at Eton. At this time the family lived at Mall Chambers, Notting Hill
   Gate. Blair remained at Eton until December 1921, when he left midway
   between his 18th and 19th birthdays. Wellington was "beastly", Blair
   told Jacintha, but he said he was "interested and happy" at Eton.^[24]
   His principal tutor was A. S. F. Gow, Fellow of Trinity College,
   Cambridge, who gave him advice later in his career.^[11] Blair was
   taught French by Aldous Huxley. Steven Runciman, who was at Eton with
   Blair, noted that he and his contemporaries appreciated Huxley's
   linguistic flair.^[25]

   Blair's performance reports suggest he neglected his studies,^[25] but
   he worked with Roger Mynors to produce a college magazine, The Election
   Times, joined in the production of other publications—College Days and
   Bubble and Squeak—and participated in the Eton Wall Game. His parents
   could not afford to send him to university without another scholarship,
   and they concluded from his poor results he would not be able to win
   one. Runciman noted he had a romantic idea about the East,^[25] and the
   family decided Blair should join the Imperial Police, the precursor of
   the Indian Police Service. For this he had to pass an entrance
   examination. In December 1921, he left Eton and travelled to join his
   retired father, mother, and younger sister Avril, who that month had
   moved to 40 Stradbroke Road, Southwold, Suffolk, the first of their
   four homes in the town.^[26] Blair was enrolled at a crammer there
   called Craighurst, and brushed up on his Classics, English, and
   History. He passed the exam, coming seventh out of the 26 who
   passed.^[11]^[27]

Policing in Burma

   Blair pictured in a passport photograph in Burma. This was the last
   time he had a toothbrush moustache; he would later acquire a pencil
   moustache similar to other British officers stationed in Burma.

   Blair's maternal grandmother lived at Moulmein, so he chose a posting
   in Burma, then still a province of British India. In October 1922 he
   sailed on board SS Herefordshire to join the Indian Imperial Police in
   Burma. A month later, he arrived at Rangoon and travelled to the police
   training school in Mandalay. He was appointed an Assistant District
   Superintendent (on probation) on 29 November 1922,^[28] at the pay of
   Rs. 525 per month.^[29] After a short posting at Maymyo, Burma's
   principal hill station, he was posted to the frontier outpost of
   Myaungmya in the Irrawaddy Delta at the beginning of 1924.^[30]

   Working as an imperial police officer gave him considerable
   responsibility while most of his contemporaries were still at
   university in England. When he was posted farther east in the Delta to
   Twante as a sub-divisional police officer, he was responsible for the
   security of some 200,000 people. At the end of 1924, he was posted to
   Syriam, closer to Rangoon. Syriam had the refinery of the Burmah Oil
   Company, "the surrounding land a barren waste, all vegetation killed
   off by the fumes of sulphur dioxide pouring out day and night from the
   stacks of the refinery". But the town was near Rangoon, a cosmopolitan
   seaport, and Blair went into the city as often as he could, "to browse
   in a bookshop; to eat well-cooked food; to get away from the boring
   routine of police life".^[31] In September 1925 he went to Insein, the
   home of Insein Prison.^[32] By this time, Blair had completed his
   training and was receiving a monthly salary of Rs. 740, including
   allowances.^[33]

   Blair recalled he faced hostility from the Burmese, "in the end the
   sneering yellow faces of young men that met me everywhere, the insults
   hooted after me when I was at a safe distance, got badly on my nerves".
   He recalled that "I was stuck between my hatred of the empire I served
   and my rage against the evil-spirited little beasts who tried to make
   my job impossible".^[34]^[35]
   [250px-KatharBritishClub.JPG] British Club in Katha, Myanmar

   In Burma, Blair acquired a reputation as an outsider. He spent much of
   his time alone, reading or pursuing non-pukka activities, such as
   attending the churches of the Karen ethnic group. A colleague, Roger
   Beadon, recalled that Blair was fast to learn the language and that
   before he left Burma, "was able to speak fluently with Burmese priests
   in 'very high-flown Burmese'".^[36] Blair made changes to his
   appearance in Burma that remained for the rest of his life, including
   adopting a pencil moustache. Emma Larkin writes in the introduction to
   Burmese Days:^[37]

     While in Burma, he acquired a moustache similar to those worn by
     officers of the British regiments stationed there. [He] also
     acquired some tattoos; on each knuckle he had a small untidy blue
     circle. Many Burmese living in rural areas still sport tattoos like
     this—they are believed to protect against bullets and snake bites.

   In April 1926 he moved to Moulmein, where his maternal grandmother
   lived. At the end of that year, he was assigned to Katha in Upper
   Burma, where he contracted dengue fever in 1927. Entitled to a leave in
   England that year, he was allowed to return in July due to his illness.
   While on holiday with his family in Cornwall in September 1927, he
   reappraised his life. Deciding against returning to Burma, he resigned
   from the Indian Imperial Police to become a writer, with effect from 12
   March 1928.^[38] He drew on his experiences in the Burma police for the
   novel Burmese Days (1934) and the essays "A Hanging" (1931) and
   "Shooting an Elephant" (1936).^[39]

London and Paris

   [250px-George_Orwell%27s_Home%2C_Notting_Hill%2C_London.jpg] The blue
   house on the right was Blair's 1927 lodgings in Portobello Road,
   London.

   In England, he settled back in the family home at Southwold, renewing
   acquaintance with local friends and attending an Old Etonian dinner. He
   visited his old tutor Gow at Cambridge for advice on becoming a
   writer.^[40] In 1927 he moved to London.^[41] Ruth Pitter, a family
   acquaintance, helped him find lodgings, and by the end of 1927 he had
   moved into rooms in Portobello Road;^[42] a blue plaque commemorates
   his residence there.^[43] Pitter's involvement in the move "would have
   lent it a reassuring respectability in Mrs. Blair's eyes". Pitter had a
   sympathetic interest in Blair's writing, pointed out weaknesses in his
   poetry, and advised him to write about what he knew. In fact he decided
   to write of "certain aspects of the present that he set out to know"
   and ventured into the East End of London—the first of the occasional
   sorties he would make intermittently over a period of five years to
   discover the world of poverty and the down-and-outers who inhabit
   it.^[44]

   In imitation of Jack London, whose writing he admired (particularly The
   People of the Abyss), Blair started to explore the poorer parts of
   London. On his first outing he set out to Limehouse Causeway, spending
   his first night in a common lodging house, possibly George Levy's
   "kip". For a while he "went native" in his own country, dressing like a
   tramp, adopting the name P.S. Burton; he recorded his experiences of
   the low life for use in "The Spike", his first published essay in
   English, and in the second half of his first book, Down and Out in
   Paris and London (1933).^[45]
   [250px-Rue_du_Pot-de-Fer.JPG] Rue du Pot de Fer on the Left Bank in the
   5th arrondissement, where Blair lived in Paris

   In early 1928 he moved to Paris. He lived in the rue du Pot de Fer, a
   working class district in the 5th arrondissement.^[11] His aunt Ellen
   (Nellie) Kate Limouzin also lived in Paris (with the Esperantist Eugène
   Lanti) and gave him social and, when necessary, financial support. He
   began to write novels, including an early version of Burmese Days, but
   nothing else survives from that period.^[11] He was more successful as
   a journalist and published articles in Monde, a political/literary
   journal edited by Henri Barbusse (his first article as a professional
   writer, "La Censure en Angleterre", appeared in that journal on 6
   October 1928); G. K.'s Weekly, where his first article to appear in
   England, "A Farthing Newspaper", was printed on 29 December 1928;^[46]
   and Le Progrès Civique (founded by the left-wing coalition Le Cartel
   des Gauches). Three pieces appeared in successive weeks in Le Progrès
   Civique: discussing unemployment, a day in the life of a tramp, and the
   beggars of London, respectively. "In one or another of its destructive
   forms, poverty was to become his obsessive subject—at the heart of
   almost everything he wrote until Homage to Catalonia."^[47]

   He fell seriously ill in February 1929 and was taken to the Hôpital
   Cochin, a free hospital where medical students were trained. His
   experiences there were the basis of his essay "How the Poor Die",
   published in 1946 (though he chose not to identify the hospital).
   Shortly afterwards, he had all his money stolen from his lodging house.
   Whether through necessity or to collect material, he undertook menial
   jobs such as dishwashing in a fashionable hotel on the rue de Rivoli,
   which he later described in Down and Out in Paris and London. In August
   1929, he sent a copy of "The Spike" to John Middleton Murry's New
   Adelphi magazine in London. The magazine was edited by Max Plowman and
   Sir Richard Rees, and Plowman accepted the work for publication.^[48]

Southwold

   [250px-SouthwoldPier.JPG] Southwold Pier in Southwold. Orwell wrote A
   Clergyman's Daughter (1935) in the town, basing the fictional town of
   Knype Hill partly on Southwold.

   In December 1929, after nearly two years in Paris, Blair returned to
   England and went directly to his parents' house in Southwold, a coastal
   town in Suffolk, which remained his base for the next five years. The
   family was well established in the town, where his sister Avril ran a
   tea-house. He became acquainted with many local people, including
   Brenda Salkeld, the clergyman's daughter who worked as a gym-teacher at
   St Felix Girls' School. Although Salkeld rejected his offer of
   marriage, she remained a friend and regular correspondent for many
   years. He also renewed friendships with older friends, such as Dennis
   Collings, whose girlfriend Eleanor Jacques was also to play a part in
   his life.^[11]

   In early 1930 he stayed briefly in Bramley, Leeds, with his sister
   Marjorie and her husband Humphrey Dakin. Blair was writing reviews for
   Adelphi and acting as a private tutor to a disabled child at Southwold.
   He then became tutor to three young brothers, one of whom, Richard
   Peters, later became a distinguished academic.^[49]

     His history in these years is marked by dualities and contrasts.
     There is Blair leading a respectable, outwardly eventless life at
     his parents' house in Southwold, writing; then in contrast, there is
     Blair as Burton (the name he used in his down-and-out episodes) in
     search of experience in the kips and spikes, in the East End, on the
     road, and in the hop fields of Kent.^[50]

   He went painting and bathing on the beach, and there he met Mabel and
   Francis Fierz, who later influenced his career. Over the next year he
   visited them in London, often meeting their friend Max Plowman. He also
   often stayed at the homes of Ruth Pitter and Richard Rees, where he
   could "change" for his sporadic tramping expeditions. One of his jobs
   was domestic work at a lodgings for half a crown (two shillings and
   sixpence, or one-eighth of a pound) a day.^[51]

   Blair now contributed regularly to Adelphi, with "A Hanging" appearing
   in August 1931. From August to September 1931 his explorations of
   poverty continued, and, like the protagonist of A Clergyman's Daughter,
   he followed the East End tradition of working in the Kent hop fields.
   He kept a diary about his experiences there. Afterwards, he lodged in
   the Tooley Street kip, but could not stand it for long, and with
   financial help from his parents moved to Windsor Street, where he
   stayed until Christmas. "Hop Picking", by Eric Blair, appeared in the
   October 1931 issue of New Statesman, whose editorial staff included his
   old friend Cyril Connolly. Mabel Fierz put him in contact with Leonard
   Moore, who became his literary agent in April 1932.^[52]

   At this time Jonathan Cape rejected A Scullion's Diary, the first
   version of Down and Out. On the advice of Richard Rees, he offered it
   to Faber & Faber, but their editorial director, T. S. Eliot, also
   rejected it. Blair ended the year by deliberately getting himself
   arrested,^[53] so that he could experience Christmas in prison, but
   after he was picked up and taken to Bethnal Green police station in the
   East End of London the authorities did not regard his "drunk and
   disorderly" behaviour as imprisonable, and after two days in a cell he
   returned home to Southwold.^[53]

Teaching career

   In April 1932 Blair became a teacher at The Hawthorns High School, a
   school for boys, in Hayes, west London. This was a small private
   school, and had only 14 or 16 boys aged between ten and sixteen, and
   one other master.^[54] While at the school he became friendly with the
   curate of the local parish church and became involved with activities
   there. Mabel Fierz had pursued matters with Moore, and at the end of
   June 1932, Moore told Blair that Victor Gollancz was prepared to
   publish A Scullion's Diary for a £40 advance, through his recently
   founded publishing house, Victor Gollancz Ltd, which was an outlet for
   radical and socialist works.^[55]

   At the end of the summer term in 1932, Blair returned to Southwold,
   where his parents had used a legacy to buy their own home. Blair and
   his sister Avril spent the holidays making the house habitable while he
   also worked on Burmese Days.^[56] He was also spending time with
   Eleanor Jacques, but her attachment to Dennis Collings remained an
   obstacle to his hopes of a more serious relationship.

   The pen name George Orwell was inspired by the River Orwell in the
   English county of Suffolk.^[57]

   "Clink", an essay describing his failed attempt to get sent to prison,
   appeared in the August 1932 number of Adelphi. He returned to teaching
   at Hayes and prepared for the publication of his book, now known as
   Down and Out in Paris and London. He wished to publish under a
   different name to avoid any embarrassment to his family over his time
   as a "tramp".^[58] In a letter to Moore (dated 15 November 1932), he
   left the choice of pseudonym to Moore and to Gollancz. Four days later,
   he wrote to Moore, suggesting the pseudonyms P.S. Burton (a name he
   used when tramping), Kenneth Miles, George Orwell, and H. Lewis
   Allways.^[59] He finally adopted the pen name George Orwell because "It
   is a good round English name."^[60] The name George was inspired by the
   patron saint of England, and Orwell after the River Orwell in Suffolk
   which was one of Orwell's favourite locations.^[61]

   Down and Out in Paris and London was published by Victor Gollancz in
   London on 9 January 1933 and received favourable reviews, with Cecil
   Day-Lewis complimenting Orwell's "clarity and good sense", and The
   Times Literary Supplement comparing Orwell's eccentric characters to
   the characters of Dickens.^[61] Down and Out was modestly successful
   and was next published by Harper & Brothers in New York.^[61]

   In mid-1933 Blair left Hawthorns to become a teacher at Frays College,
   in Uxbridge, west London. This was a much larger establishment with 200
   pupils and a full complement of staff. He acquired a motorcycle and
   took trips through the surrounding countryside. On one of these
   expeditions he became soaked and caught a chill that developed into
   pneumonia. He was taken to a cottage hospital in Uxbridge, where for a
   time his life was believed to be in danger. When he was discharged in
   January 1934, he returned to Southwold to convalesce and, supported by
   his parents, never returned to teaching.^[62]

   He was disappointed when Gollancz turned down Burmese Days, mainly on
   the grounds of potential suits for libel, but Harper were prepared to
   publish it in the United States. Meanwhile, Blair started work on the
   novel A Clergyman's Daughter, drawing upon his life as a teacher and on
   life in Southwold. Eventually in October, after sending A Clergyman's
   Daughter to Moore, he left for London to take a job that had been found
   for him by his aunt Nellie Limouzin.^[61]

Hampstead

   [250px-Orwell_hampstead_home.JPG]

   [250px-George_Orwell_in_Hampstead_-_geograph.org.uk_-_432863.jpg]
   His time as a bookseller is marked with this plaque in Pond Street,
   Hampstead.

   This job was as a part-time assistant in Booklovers' Corner, a
   second-hand bookshop in Hampstead run by Francis and Myfanwy Westrope,
   who were friends of Nellie Limouzin in the Esperanto movement. The
   Westropes were friendly and provided him with comfortable accommodation
   at Warwick Mansions, Pond Street. He was sharing the job with Jon
   Kimche, who also lived with the Westropes. Blair worked at the shop in
   the afternoons and had his mornings free to write and his evenings free
   to socialise. These experiences provided background for the novel Keep
   the Aspidistra Flying (1936). As well as the various guests of the
   Westropes, he was able to enjoy the company of Richard Rees and the
   Adelphi writers and Mabel Fierz. The Westropes and Kimche were members
   of the Independent Labour Party, although at this time Blair was not
   seriously politically active. He was writing for the Adelphi and
   preparing A Clergyman's Daughter and Burmese Days for publication.^[63]
   [250px-GEORGE_ORWELL_1903-1950_Novelist_and_Political_Essayist_lived_he
   re.jpg] English Heritage blue plaque in Kentish Town, London, where
   Orwell lived from August 1935 until January 1936

   At the beginning of 1935 he had to move out of Warwick Mansions, and
   Mabel Fierz found him a flat in Parliament Hill. A Clergyman's Daughter
   was published on 11 March 1935. In early 1935 Blair met his future wife
   Eileen O'Shaughnessy, when his landlady, Rosalind Obermeyer, who was
   studying for a master's degree in psychology at University College
   London, invited some of her fellow students to a party. One of these
   students, Elizaveta Fen, recalled Blair and his friend Richard Rees
   "draped" at the fireplace, looking, she thought, "moth-eaten and
   prematurely aged".^[64] Around this time, Blair had started to write
   reviews for The New English Weekly.^[65]

   In June, Burmese Days was published and Cyril Connolly's positive
   review in the New Statesman prompted Blair to re-establish contact with
   his old friend. In August, he moved into a flat, at 50 Lawford Road,
   Kentish Town, which he shared with Michael Sayers and Rayner
   Heppenstall. The relationship was sometimes awkward and Blair and
   Heppenstall even came to blows, though they remained friends and later
   worked together on BBC broadcasts.^[66] Blair was now working on Keep
   the Aspidistra Flying, and also tried unsuccessfully to write a serial
   for the News Chronicle. By October 1935 his flatmates had moved out and
   he was struggling to pay the rent on his own. He remained until the end
   of January 1936, when he stopped working at Booklovers' Corner. In
   1980, English Heritage honoured Orwell with a blue plaque at his
   Kentish Town residence.^[67]

The Road to Wigan Pier

   Main article: The Road to Wigan Pier

   At this time, Victor Gollancz suggested Orwell spend a short time
   investigating social conditions in economically depressed Northern
   England.^[n 2] The Depression had introduced a number of working-class
   writers from the North of England to the reading public. It was one of
   these working-class authors, Jack Hilton, whom Orwell sought for
   advice. Orwell had written to Hilton seeking lodging and asking for
   recommendations on his route. Hilton was unable to provide him lodging,
   but suggested that he travel to Wigan rather than Rochdale, "for there
   are the colliers and they're good stuff".^[69]

   On 31 January 1936, Orwell set out by public transport and on foot.
   Arriving in Manchester after the banks had closed, he had to stay in a
   common lodging-house. The next day he picked up a list of contacts sent
   by Richard Rees. One of these, the trade union official Frank Meade,
   suggested Wigan, where Orwell spent February staying in dirty lodgings
   over a tripe shop. In Wigan, he visited many homes to see how people
   lived, went down Bryn Hall coal mine, and used the local public library
   to consult public health records and reports on working conditions in
   mines.^[70]

   During this time, he was distracted by concerns about style and
   possible libel in Keep the Aspidistra Flying. He made a quick visit to
   Liverpool and during March, stayed in south Yorkshire, spending time in
   Sheffield and Barnsley. As well as visiting mines, including
   Grimethorpe, and observing social conditions, he attended meetings of
   the Communist Party and of Oswald Mosley ("his speech the usual
   claptrap—The blame for everything was put upon mysterious international
   gangs of Jews") where he saw the tactics of the Blackshirts.^[71] He
   also made visits to his sister at Headingley, during which he visited
   the Brontë Parsonage at Haworth.^[72]

   Lane, Wallington, Hertfordshire, Orwell's residence c. 1936–1940

   Orwell needed somewhere he could concentrate on writing his book, and
   once again help was provided by Aunt Nellie, who was living at
   Wallington, Hertfordshire, in a very small 16th-century cottage called
   the "Stores". Orwell took over the tenancy and moved in on 2 April
   1936.^[73] He started work on The Road to Wigan Pier by the end of
   April, but also spent hours working on the garden, planting a rose
   garden which is still extant, and revealing four years later that
   "outside my work the thing I care most about is gardening, especially
   vegetable gardening".^[74] He also tested the possibility of reopening
   the Stores as a village shop. Keep the Aspidistra Flying was published
   by Gollancz on 20 April 1936. On 4 August, Orwell gave a talk at the
   Adelphi Summer School held at Langham, entitled An Outsider Sees the
   Distressed Areas; others who spoke at the school included John
   Strachey, Max Plowman, Karl Polanyi and Reinhold Niebuhr.^[75]

   The result of his journeys through the north was The Road to Wigan
   Pier, published by Gollancz for the Left Book Club in 1937.^[76] The
   first half of the book documents his social investigations of
   Lancashire and Yorkshire, including an evocative description of working
   life in the coal mines. The second half is a long essay on his
   upbringing and the development of his political conscience, which
   includes an argument for socialism. Gollancz feared the second half
   would offend readers and added a disculpatory preface to the book while
   Orwell was in Spain.^[77] Orwell's research for The Road to Wigan Pier
   led to him being placed under surveillance by the Special Branch from
   1936.^[78]

   Orwell married O'Shaughnessy on 9 June 1936. Shortly afterwards, the
   political crisis began in Spain and Orwell followed developments there
   closely. At the end of the year, concerned by Francisco Franco's
   military uprising, Orwell decided to go to Spain to take part in the
   Spanish Civil War on the Republican side. Under the erroneous
   impression that he needed papers from some left-wing organisation to
   cross the frontier, on John Strachey's recommendation he applied
   unsuccessfully to Harry Pollitt, leader of the British Communist Party.
   Pollitt was suspicious of Orwell's political reliability; he asked him
   whether he would undertake to join the International Brigades and
   advised him to get a safe-conduct from the Spanish Embassy in
   Paris.^[79] Not wishing to commit himself until he had seen the
   situation in situ, Orwell instead used his Independent Labour Party
   contacts to get a letter of introduction to John McNair in
   Barcelona.^[80]

Spanish Civil War

   [250px-Placa_de_George_Orwell_in_Barcelona_3.jpg] The square in
   Barcelona renamed in Orwell's honour

   Orwell set out for Spain on about 23 December 1936, dining with Henry
   Miller in Paris on the way. Miller told Orwell that going to fight in
   the Civil War out of some sense of obligation or guilt was "sheer
   stupidity" and that the Englishman's ideas "about combating Fascism,
   defending democracy, etc., etc., were all baloney".^[81] A few days
   later in Barcelona, Orwell met John McNair of the Independent Labour
   Party (ILP) Office.^[82]^[83] The Republican government was supported
   by a number of factions with conflicting aims, including the Workers'
   Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), the anarcho-syndicalist
   Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and the Unified Socialist
   Party of Catalonia (a wing of the Spanish Communist Party). Orwell was
   at first exasperated by this "kaleidoscope" of political parties and
   trade unions.^[83] The ILP was linked to the POUM so Orwell joined the
   POUM.^[84]

   After a time at the Lenin Barracks in Barcelona he was sent to the
   relatively quiet Aragon Front under Georges Kopp. By January 1937 he
   was at Alcubierre 1,500 feet (460 m) above sea level, in the depth of
   winter. There was very little military action and Orwell was shocked by
   the lack of munitions, food and firewood as well as other extreme
   deprivations.^[85] With his Cadet Corps and police training, Orwell was
   quickly made a corporal. On the arrival of a British ILP Contingent
   about three weeks later, Orwell and the other English militiaman,
   Williams, were sent with them to Monte Oscuro and on to Huesca.

   Meanwhile, back in England, Eileen had been handling the issues
   relating to the publication of The Road to Wigan Pier before setting
   out for Spain herself, leaving Nellie Limouzin to look after The
   Stores. Eileen volunteered for a post in John McNair's office and with
   the help of Georges Kopp paid visits to her husband, bringing him
   English tea, chocolate and cigars.^[86] Orwell had to spend some days
   in hospital with a poisoned hand^[87] and had most of his possessions
   stolen by the staff. He returned to the front and saw some action in a
   night attack on the Nationalist trenches where he chased an enemy
   soldier with a bayonet and bombed an enemy rifle position.

   In April, Orwell returned to Barcelona.^[87] Wanting to be sent to the
   Madrid front, which meant he "must join the International Column", he
   approached a Communist friend attached to the Spanish Medical Aid and
   explained his case. "Although he did not think much of the Communists,
   Orwell was still ready to treat them as friends and allies. That would
   soon change."^[88] During the Barcelona May Days Orwell was caught up
   in the factional fighting. He spent much of the time on a roof, with a
   stack of novels, but encountered Jon Kimche from his Hampstead days
   during the stay. The subsequent campaign of lies and distortion carried
   out by the Communist press,^[89] in which the POUM was accused of
   collaborating with the fascists, had a dramatic effect on Orwell.
   Instead of joining the International Brigades as he had intended, he
   decided to return to the Aragon Front. Once the May fighting was over,
   he was approached by a Communist friend who asked if he still intended
   transferring to the International Brigades. Orwell expressed surprise
   that they should still want him, because according to the Communist
   press he was a fascist.^[90]
   [250px-George_orwell.jpg] Memorial plaque in Lleida marking where
   Orwell received treatment at the Hospital Santa María de Lleida for his
   bullet wound to the neck

   After his return to the front, he was wounded in the throat by a
   sniper's bullet. At 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m), Orwell was considerably taller
   than the Spanish fighters^[91] and had been warned against standing
   against the trench parapet. Unable to speak, and with blood pouring
   from his mouth, Orwell was carried on a stretcher to Siétamo, loaded on
   an ambulance and sent to hospital in Lleida. He recovered sufficiently
   to get up and on 27 May 1937 was sent on to Tarragona and two days
   later to a POUM sanatorium in the suburbs of Barcelona. The bullet had
   missed his main artery by the barest margin and his voice was barely
   audible. It had been such a clean shot that the wound immediately went
   through the process of cauterisation. He received electrotherapy
   treatment and was declared medically unfit for service.^[92]

   By the middle of June, the political situation in Barcelona had
   deteriorated and the POUM—painted by the pro-Soviet Communists as a
   Trotskyist organisation—was outlawed and under attack.^[93] Members,
   including Kopp, were arrested and others were in hiding. Orwell and his
   wife were under threat and had to lie low,^[n 3] although they broke
   cover to try to help Kopp. They finally escaped from Spain by train. In
   the first week of July 1937 Orwell arrived back at Wallington; on 13
   July 1937 a deposition was presented to the Tribunal for Espionage and
   High Treason in Valencia, charging the Orwells with "rabid Trotskyism",
   and being agents of the POUM.^[94] The trial of the leaders of the POUM
   and of Orwell (in his absence) took place in Barcelona in October and
   November 1938. Observing events from French Morocco, Orwell wrote that
   they were "only a by-product of the Russian Trotskyist trials and from
   the start every kind of lie, including flagrant absurdities, has been
   circulated in the Communist press".^[95] Orwell's experiences in the
   Spanish Civil War gave rise to Homage to Catalonia (1938).

   In his book, The International Brigades: Fascism, Freedom and the
   Spanish Civil War, Giles Tremlett writes that according to Soviet
   files, Orwell and his wife Eileen were spied on in Barcelona in May
   1937.^[96]

Rest and recuperation

   [250px-24_Crooms_Hill%2C_Greenwich%2C_London-11July2010.jpg] Laurence
   O'Shaughnessy's former home, the large house on the corner, 24 Crooms
   Hill, Greenwich, London^[97]

   Orwell returned to England in June 1937, and stayed at the
   O'Shaughnessy home at Greenwich. He found his views on the Spanish
   Civil War out of favour, but praised the book Red Spanish Notebook: the
   first six months of revolution and the civil war by Juan Ramón Breá and
   Mary Stanley Low in a review for Time and Tide magazine.^[98] Kingsley
   Martin rejected two of Orwell's works and Gollancz was equally
   cautious. At the same time, the communist Daily Worker was running an
   attack on The Road to Wigan Pier, taking out of context Orwell writing
   that "the working classes smell"; a letter to Gollancz from Orwell
   threatening libel action brought a stop to this. Orwell was also able
   to find a more sympathetic publisher for his views in Fredric Warburg
   of Secker & Warburg. Orwell returned to Wallington, which he found in
   disarray after his absence. He acquired goats, a cockerel (rooster) he
   called Henry Ford and a poodle puppy he called Marx;^[99]^[100]^[101]
   and settled down to animal husbandry and writing Homage to Catalonia.

   There were thoughts of going to India to work on The Pioneer, a
   newspaper in Lucknow, but by March 1938 Orwell's health had
   deteriorated. He was admitted to Preston Hall Sanatorium at Aylesford,
   Kent, a Royal British Legion Industries hospital for ex-servicemen to
   which his brother-in-law Laurence O'Shaughnessy was attached. He was
   thought initially to be suffering from tuberculosis and stayed in the
   sanatorium until September. Homage to Catalonia was published in London
   by Secker & Warburg and was a commercial flop; it re-emerged in the
   1950s, following on the success of Orwell's later books.^[102]

   The novelist L.H. Myers secretly funded a trip to French Morocco for
   half a year for Orwell to avoid the English winter and recover his
   health. The Orwells set out in September 1938 via Gibraltar and Tangier
   to avoid Spanish Morocco and arrived at Marrakesh. They rented a villa
   on the road to Casablanca and during that time Orwell wrote Coming Up
   for Air. They arrived back in England on 30 March 1939 and Coming Up
   for Air was published in June. Orwell spent time in Wallington and
   Southwold working on an essay about Charles Dickens. In June 1939,
   Orwell's father died.^[103]

Second World War and Animal Farm

   [250px-George_Orwell_and_Sir_Stephen_Spender_%28Marchmont_Association%2
   9.jpg] Based in Lansdowne Terrace, Bloomsbury, London, Orwell wrote for
   Horizon magazine (co-founded by Stephen Spender) from 1940

   At the outbreak of the Second World War, Orwell's wife Eileen started
   working in the Censorship Department of the Ministry of Information in
   central London, staying during the week with her family in Greenwich.
   Orwell submitted his name to the Central Register for war work, but
   nothing transpired. He returned to Wallington, and in late 1939 he
   wrote material for his first collection of essays, Inside the Whale.
   For the next year he was occupied writing reviews for plays, films and
   books for The Listener, Time and Tide and New Adelphi. On 29 March 1940
   his long association with Tribune began^[104] with a review of a
   sergeant's account of Napoleon's retreat from Moscow. At the beginning
   of 1940, the first edition of Connolly's Horizon appeared, and this
   provided a new outlet for Orwell's work and new literary contacts. In
   May the Orwells took lease of a flat in London at Dorset Chambers,
   Chagford Street, Marylebone. It was the time of the Dunkirk evacuation,
   and the death in Flanders of Eileen's brother Laurence O'Shaughnessy
   caused her considerable grief and long-term depression.^[105]

   Orwell was declared "unfit for any kind of military service" by the
   Medical Board in June, but soon joined the Home Guard.^[106] He shared
   Tom Wintringham's socialist vision for the Home Guard as a
   revolutionary People's Militia. His lecture notes for instructing
   platoon members include advice on street fighting, field
   fortifications, and the use of mortars. Sergeant Orwell recruited
   Fredric Warburg to his unit. During the Battle of Britain he spent
   weekends with Warburg and his new Zionist friend, Tosco Fyvel, at
   Warburg's house at Twyford, Berkshire. At Wallington he worked on
   "England Your England" and in London wrote reviews for periodicals.
   Visiting Eileen's family in Greenwich brought him face-to-face with the
   effects of the German Blitz bombings. In 1940 he first worked for the
   BBC as a producer on their Indian Section, while the broadcaster and
   writer Venu Chitale was his secretary.^[107] In mid-1940, Warburg,
   Fyvel and Orwell planned Searchlight Books. Eleven volumes eventually
   appeared, of which Orwell's The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the
   English Genius, published in February 1941, was the first.^[108]

   Early in 1941 he began to write for the American Partisan Review which
   linked Orwell with the New York Intellectuals who were also
   anti-Stalinist,^[109] and contributed to the Gollancz anthology The
   Betrayal of the Left, written in the light of the Molotov–Ribbentrop
   Pact. He applied unsuccessfully for a job at the Air Ministry.
   Meanwhile, he was still writing reviews of books and plays and met the
   novelist Anthony Powell. He took part in radio broadcasts for the
   Eastern Service of the BBC. In March the Orwells moved to a
   seventh-floor flat at Langford Court, St John's Wood, while at
   Wallington Orwell was "digging for victory" by planting potatoes.

     One could not have a better example of the moral and emotional
     shallowness of our time, than the fact that we are now all more or
     less pro Stalin. This disgusting murderer is temporarily on our
     side, and so the purges, etc., are suddenly forgotten.

   — George Orwell, in his war-time diary, 3 July 1941^[110]

   In August 1941, Orwell finally obtained "war work" when he was taken on
   full-time by the BBC's Eastern Service.^[111] He supervised cultural
   broadcasts to India, to counter propaganda from Nazi Germany designed
   to undermine imperial links.^[112]

   At the end of August he had a dinner with H. G. Wells which degenerated
   into a row because Wells had taken offence at observations Orwell made
   about him in a Horizon article. In October Orwell had a bout of
   bronchitis; the illness recurred frequently. David Astor was looking
   for a provocative contributor for The Observer Sunday newspaper, and
   invited Orwell to write for him; the first article appeared in March
   1942. In early 1942 Eileen changed jobs to work at the Ministry of
   Food, and in mid-1942 the Orwells moved to a larger flat, 10a Mortimer
   Crescent in Maida Vale/Kilburn.^[113]
   [250px-George-orwell-BBC.jpg] Orwell spoke on many BBC and other
   broadcasts, but no recordings are known to survive.^[114]^[115]^[116]

   At the BBC, Orwell introduced Voice, a literary programme for his
   Indian broadcasts, and by now was leading an active social life with
   literary friends, particularly on the political left. Late in 1942 he
   started writing regularly for the left-wing weekly Tribune^[117]^[118]
   directed by Labour MPs Aneurin Bevan and George Strauss. In March 1943,
   Orwell's mother died, and around this time he told Moore he was
   starting work on a book, which turned out to be Animal Farm.

   In September 1943, Orwell resigned from the BBC^[119]^: 352  following
   a report confirming his fears that few Indians listened to the
   broadcasts,^[120] but he was also keen to concentrate on writing Animal
   Farm. On 24 November 1943, six days before his last day of service, his
   adaptation of the fairy tale, Hans Christian Andersen's The Emperor's
   New Clothes was broadcast. It was a genre in which he was greatly
   interested and which appeared on Animal Farm's title page.^[121] He
   resigned from the Home Guard on medical grounds.^[122]

   In November 1943, Orwell was appointed literary editor at Tribune,
   where his assistant was his friend Jon Kimche. Orwell was on the staff
   until early 1945, writing over 80 book reviews,^[123] and on 3 December
   1943 started his regular personal column "As I Please".^[124] He was
   still writing reviews for other magazines, including Partisan Review,
   Horizon, and the New York Nation. By April 1944 Animal Farm was ready
   for publication. Gollancz refused to publish it, considering it an
   attack on the regime of the Soviet Union, a crucial ally in the war. A
   similar fate was met from other publishers, including T. S. Eliot at
   Faber & Faber, until Jonathan Cape agreed to take it.

   Orwell and Eileen wanted children, but he was sterile and she may also
   have been infertile due to uterine cancer.^[125] In May the Orwells had
   the opportunity to adopt a child, thanks to the contacts of Eileen's
   sister-in-law Gwen O'Shaughnessy,^[99] then a doctor in Newcastle upon
   Tyne. In June a V-1 flying bomb struck Mortimer Crescent and the
   Orwells had to find somewhere else to live. Orwell had to scrabble
   around in the rubble for his books, which he had finally managed to
   transfer from Wallington, carting them away in a wheelbarrow. Another
   blow was Cape's reversal of his plan to publish Animal Farm. The
   decision followed his visit to Peter Smollett, an official at the
   Ministry of Information, who was later identified as a Soviet
   agent.^[126]^[127] The Orwells spent time in the North East, near
   Carlton, County Durham, dealing with the adoption of a boy whom they
   named Richard Horatio Blair.^[128] By September 1944 they had set up
   home in Islington, at 27b Canonbury Square.^[129] Baby Richard joined
   them there, and Eileen gave up her work at the Ministry of Food to look
   after her family. Secker & Warburg had agreed to publish Animal Farm,
   planned for the following March, although it did not appear in print
   until August 1945. By February 1945 David Astor had invited Orwell to
   become a war correspondent for The Observer. He went to liberated
   Paris, then to Germany and Austria, to cities including Cologne and
   Stuttgart. He was never in the front line, under fire, but followed the
   troops closely, "sometimes entering a captured town within a day of its
   fall while dead bodies lay in the streets".^[130] Some of his reports
   were published in the Manchester Evening News.^[131]

   While he was there, Eileen went into hospital for a hysterectomy. She
   had not given Orwell much notice about the operation because of worries
   about the cost, and because she expected to make a speedy recovery;
   however she died on 29 March 1945 of an allergic reaction to the
   anaesthetic she was given.^[125] It was expected that he would give up
   his nine-month-old adopted son, but he did not.^[125] Orwell returned
   home and then went back to Europe. He returned to London to cover the
   1945 general election at the beginning of July. Animal Farm: A Fairy
   Story was published in Britain on 17 August 1945, and in America on
   26 August 1946.^[132]

Jura and Nineteen Eighty-Four

   Animal Farm had particular resonance in the post-war climate and its
   worldwide success made Orwell a sought-after figure. For the next four
   years, Orwell mixed journalistic work—mainly for Tribune, The Observer
   and the Manchester Evening News, though he also contributed to many
   small-circulation political and literary magazines—with writing his
   best-known work, Nineteen Eighty-Four, which was published in 1949. He
   was a leading figure in the so-called Shanghai Club (named after a
   restaurant in Soho) of left-leaning and émigré journalists, among them
   E. H. Carr, Sebastian Haffner, Isaac Deutscher, Barbara Ward and Jon
   Kimche.^[133]
   [250px-Barnhill_%28Cnoc_an_t-Sabhail%29_-_geograph.org.uk_-_451643.jpg]
   Barnhill farmhouse on the Isle of Jura, Scotland. Orwell completed
   Nineteen Eighty-Four while living here.

   In the year following Eileen's death he published around 130 articles
   and a selection of his Critical Essays, while remaining active in
   various political lobbying campaigns. He employed a housekeeper, Susan
   Watson, to look after his adopted son at the Islington flat, which
   visitors now described as "bleak". In September he spent a fortnight on
   the island of Jura in the Inner Hebrides and saw it as a place to
   escape from the hassle of London literary life. David Astor was
   instrumental in arranging a place for Orwell on Jura.^[134] Astor's
   family owned Scottish estates in the area and a fellow Old Etonian,
   Robin Fletcher, had a property on the island. In late 1945 and early
   1946 Orwell made several hopeless and unwelcome marriage proposals to
   younger women, including Celia Kirwan; Ann Popham, who happened to live
   in the same block of flats; and Sonia Brownell, one of Connolly's
   coterie at the Horizon office. Orwell suffered a tubercular haemorrhage
   in February 1946 but disguised his illness. In 1945 or early 1946,
   while still living at Canonbury Square, Orwell wrote an article on
   "British Cookery", complete with recipes, commissioned by the British
   Council. Given the post-war shortages, both parties agreed not to
   publish it.^[135] His sister Marjorie died in May.^[136]

   On 22 May 1946, Orwell set off with his two-year-old son, who he
   treated as a mini-adult,^[125] to live on Jura in Barnhill, an
   abandoned farmhouse without outbuildings.^[137] Conditions at the
   farmhouse were primitive but the natural history and the challenge of
   improving the place appealed to Orwell. His son found out later that
   Orwell was terrified of passing on his tuberculosis to him by hugging
   or kissing him, and concerned that this would interfere with his
   bonding with the child.^[125] Orwell returned to London in late 1946
   and picked up his literary journalism again. Now a well-known writer,
   he was swamped with work. Apart from a visit to Jura in the new year he
   stayed in London for one of the coldest British winters on record and
   with such a national shortage of fuel that he burnt his furniture and
   his child's toys. The heavy smog in the days before the Clean Air Act
   1956 did little to help his health, about which he was reticent,
   keeping clear of medical attention. Meanwhile, he had to cope with
   rival claims of publishers Gollancz and Warburg for publishing rights.
   About this time he co-edited a collection titled British Pamphleteers
   with Reginald Reynolds.

   As a result of the success of Animal Farm, Orwell was expecting a large
   bill from the Inland Revenue and he contacted a firm of accountants.
   The firm advised Orwell to establish a company to own his copyright and
   to receive his royalties and set up a "service agreement" so that he
   could draw a salary; "George Orwell Productions Ltd" (GOP Ltd) was set
   up on 12 September 1947.^[138] Orwell left London for Jura on 10 April
   1947.^[11] In July he ended the lease on the Wallington cottage.^[139]
   Back on Jura he worked on Nineteen Eighty-Four. During that time his
   sister's family visited, and Orwell led a disastrous boating
   expedition, on 19 August,^[140] which nearly led to loss of life whilst
   trying to cross the notorious Gulf of Corryvreckan and gave him a
   soaking which was not good for his health. In December a chest
   specialist was summoned from Glasgow who pronounced Orwell seriously
   ill, and a week before Christmas 1947 he was in Hairmyres Hospital.
   Tuberculosis was diagnosed and the request for permission to import the
   new medicine streptomycin to treat Orwell went as far as Aneurin Bevan,
   then Minister of Health. David Astor helped with supply and payment and
   Orwell began his course of streptomycin on 19 or 20 February
   1948.^[141] By the end of July 1948 Orwell was able to return to Jura
   and by December he had finished the manuscript of Nineteen Eighty-Four.
   In January 1949, in a very weak condition, he set off for a sanatorium
   at Cranham, Gloucestershire. However, streptomycin could not be
   continued, as he developed toxic epidermal necrolysis, a rare side
   effect.^[142]
   [330px-Animal_Farm_strip_cartoon.jpg] One of the Animal Farm cartoon
   strips produced for the Cold War anti-communist department of the
   British Foreign Office, the Information Research Department (IRD)

   The sanatorium at Cranham consisted of a series of small wooden chalets
   or huts in a remote part of the Cotswolds near Stroud. Visitors were
   shocked by Orwell's appearance and concerned by the shortcomings and
   ineffectiveness of the treatment. Friends were worried about his
   finances, but by now he was comparatively well off. He was writing to
   many of his friends, including Jacintha Buddicom, who had
   "rediscovered" him. In March 1949 he was visited by Celia Kirwan, who
   had just started working for a Foreign Office unit, the Information
   Research Department (IRD), set up by the Labour government to publish
   anti-communist propaganda; Orwell gave her a list of people he
   considered to be unsuitable as IRD authors because of their
   pro-communist leanings. Orwell's list, not published until 2003,
   consisted mainly of writers, and some actors and Labour
   MPs.^[126]^[143] To further promote Animal Farm, the IRD commissioned
   cartoon strips, drawn by Norman Pett, to be placed in newspapers across
   the globe.^[144] Orwell received more streptomycin treatment and
   improved slightly. This repeat dose of streptomycin, especially after
   the side effect had been noticed, has been called "ill-advised".^[142]
   He then received penicillin, presumably to treat his bronchiectasis;
   doctors knew it was ineffective against tuberculosis.^[142] In June
   1949 Nineteen Eighty-Four was published to critical acclaim.^[145]

Final months and death

   [250px-UCL_Gower_Street.jpg] University College Hospital in London,
   where Orwell died

   Orwell's health continued to decline. In mid-1949, he courted Sonia
   Brownell, believed to be the model for Julia, the heroine of Nineteen
   Eighty-Four,^[146]^[147] and they announced their engagement in
   September. Shortly afterwards he was removed to University College
   Hospital in London. Brownell took charge of Orwell's affairs and
   attended him diligently in the hospital. Friends of Orwell stated that
   Brownell helped him through the painful last months of his life and,
   according to Anthony Powell, cheered Orwell up greatly.^[148] However,
   others have argued that she may have been attracted to him primarily
   because of his fame.^[142]

   In September 1949, Orwell invited his accountant Jack Harrison to visit
   him at the hospital, and Harrison claimed that Orwell then asked him to
   become director of GOP Ltd and to manage the company, but there was no
   independent witness.^[138] Orwell's wedding took place in the hospital
   room on 13 October 1949, with David Astor as best man.^[149] Further
   meetings were held with his accountant, at which Harrison and the
   Blairs were confirmed as directors of the company.^[138] Orwell's
   health was in decline again by Christmas. Harrison visited later and
   claimed that Orwell had given him 25% of the company.^[138] At the age
   of 46, Orwell suffered a pulmonary artery rupture due to complications
   of tuberculosis, and died in the early morning of 21 January
   1950.^[150]
   [250px-Grave_of_Eric_Arthur_Blair_%28George_Orwell%29%2C_All_Saints%2C_
   Sutton_Courtenay_-_geograph.org.uk_-_362277.jpg] Orwell's grave in All
   Saints' churchyard, Sutton Courtenay, Oxfordshire

   Orwell had requested to be buried "according to the rites of the Church
   of England, in the nearest convenient cemetery".^[151] The graveyards
   in central London had no space, and so in an effort to ensure his last
   wishes could be fulfilled, his widow appealed to his friends to see
   whether any of them knew of a church with space in its graveyard. David
   Astor arranged for Orwell to be interred in the churchyard of All
   Saints' Church, Sutton Courtenay,^[152] on 26 January 1950.^[153] The
   funeral was organised by Anthony Powell and Malcolm Muggeridge. Powell
   chose the hymns: "All people that on earth do dwell", "Guide me, O thou
   great Redeemer" and "Ten thousand times ten thousand".^[154]

   Orwell's adopted son, Richard Horatio Blair, was brought up by Orwell's
   sister Avril, his legal guardian, and her husband, Bill Dunn.^[155] In
   1979, Sonia Brownell brought a High Court action against Harrison when
   he declared an intention to subdivide his 25 per cent share of the
   company between his three children. For Sonia, the consequence of this
   manoeuvre would have made getting overall control of the company three
   times more difficult. She was considered to have a strong case, but was
   becoming increasingly ill and eventually was persuaded to settle out of
   court on 2 November 1980. She died on 11 December 1980, aged 62.^[138]

Writing

   During most of his career, Orwell was best known for his journalism, in
   essays, reviews, columns in newspapers and magazines and in his books
   of reportage: Down and Out in Paris and London (describing a period of
   poverty in these cities), The Road to Wigan Pier (describing the living
   conditions of the poor in northern England, and class division
   generally) and Homage to Catalonia. According to Irving Howe, Orwell
   was "the best English essayist since Hazlitt, perhaps since
   Dr Johnson".^[156]

   Modern readers are more often introduced to Orwell as a novelist,
   particularly through his enormously successful Animal Farm and Nineteen
   Eighty-Four. The former is often thought to reflect degeneration in the
   Soviet Union after the Russian Revolution and the rise of Stalinism;
   the latter, life under totalitarian rule. In 1984, Nineteen Eighty-Four
   and Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 were honoured with the Prometheus
   Award for their contributions to dystopian literature. In 2011 he
   received it again for Animal Farm. In 2003, Nineteen Eighty-Four was
   listed at number 8 and Animal Farm at number 46 on the BBC's The Big
   Read poll.^[157] In 2021, readers of the New York Times Book Review
   rated Nineteen Eighty-Four third in a list of "The best books of the
   past 125 years".^[158]

Literary influences

   In an autobiographical piece that Orwell sent to the editors of
   Twentieth Century Authors in 1940, he wrote:^[159]

     The writers I care about most and never grow tired of are:
     Shakespeare, Swift, Fielding, Dickens, Charles Reade, Flaubert and,
     among modern writers, James Joyce, T. S. Eliot and D. H. Lawrence.
     But I believe the modern writer who has influenced me most is
     W. Somerset Maugham, whom I admire immensely for his power of
     telling a story straightforwardly and without frills.

   Elsewhere, Orwell strongly praised the works of Jack London, especially
   his book The Road. Orwell's investigation of poverty in The Road to
   Wigan Pier strongly resembles that of Jack London's The People of the
   Abyss, in which the American journalist disguises himself as an
   out-of-work sailor to investigate the lives of the poor in London. In
   his essay "Politics vs. Literature: An Examination of Gulliver's
   Travels" (1946) Orwell wrote: "If I had to make a list of six books
   which were to be preserved when all others were destroyed, I would
   certainly put Gulliver's Travels among them." On H. G. Wells he wrote:
   "The minds of all of us, and therefore the physical world, would be
   perceptibly different if Wells had never existed."^[160]

   Orwell was an admirer of Arthur Koestler and became a close friend
   during the three years that Koestler and his wife Mamain spent at the
   cottage of Bwlch Ocyn in the Vale of Ffestiniog. Orwell reviewed
   Koestler's Darkness at Noon for the New Statesman in 1941,
   saying:^[161]

     Brilliant as this book is as a novel, and a piece of brilliant
     literature, it is probably most valuable as an interpretation of the
     Moscow "confessions" by someone with an inner knowledge of
     totalitarian methods. What was frightening about these trials was
     not the fact that they happened—for obviously such things are
     necessary in a totalitarian society—but the eagerness of Western
     intellectuals to justify them.

   Other writers Orwell admired included Ralph Waldo Emerson, George
   Gissing, Graham Greene, Herman Melville, Henry Miller, Tobias Smollett,
   Mark Twain, Joseph Conrad, and Yevgeny Zamyatin.^[162] He was both an
   admirer and a critic of Rudyard Kipling,^[163]^[164] praising Kipling
   as a gifted writer and a "good bad poet" whose work is "spurious" and
   "morally insensitive and aesthetically disgusting", but undeniably
   seductive and able to speak to certain aspects of reality more
   effectively than more enlightened authors.^[165] He had a similarly
   ambivalent attitude to G. K. Chesterton, whom he regarded as a writer
   of considerable talent who had chosen to devote himself to "Roman
   Catholic propaganda",^[166] and to Evelyn Waugh, who was, he wrote,
   "about as good a novelist as one can be (i.e. as novelists go today)
   while holding untenable opinions".^[167]

Literary critic

   Throughout his life Orwell continually supported himself as a
   book-reviewer. His reviews are well known and have had an influence on
   literary criticism. He wrote in the conclusion to his 1940 essay on
   Charles Dickens:^[168]

     When one reads any strongly individual piece of writing, one has the
     impression of seeing a face somewhere behind the page. It is not
     necessarily the actual face of the writer. I feel this very strongly
     with Swift, with Defoe, with Fielding, Stendhal, Thackeray,
     Flaubert, though in several cases I do not know what these people
     looked like and do not want to know. What one sees is the face that
     the writer ought to have. Well, in the case of Dickens I see a face
     that is not quite the face of Dickens's photographs, though it
     resembles it. It is the face of a man of about forty, with a small
     beard and a high colour. He is laughing, with a touch of anger in
     his laughter, but no triumph, no malignity. It is the face of a man
     who is always fighting against something, but who fights in the open
     and is not frightened, the face of a man who is generously angry—in
     other words, of a nineteenth-century liberal, a free intelligence, a
     type hated with equal hatred by all the smelly little orthodoxies
     which are now contending for our souls.

   George Woodcock suggested that the last two sentences also describe
   Orwell.^[169]

   Orwell wrote a critique of George Bernard Shaw's play Arms and the Man.
   He considered this Shaw's best play and the most likely to remain
   socially relevant. His 1945 essay In Defence of P. G. Wodehouse argues
   that his broadcasts from Germany during the war did not really make him
   a traitor. He accused the Ministry of Information of exaggerating
   Wodehouse's actions for propaganda purposes.

Food writing

   In 1946, the British Council commissioned Orwell to write an essay on
   British food as part of a drive to promote British relations
   abroad.^[170] In his essay titled "British Cookery", Orwell described
   the British diet as "a simple, rather heavy, perhaps slightly barbarous
   diet" and where "hot drinks are acceptable at most hours of the
   day".^[170] He wrote that high tea in the United Kingdom consisted of a
   variety of savoury and sweet dishes, but "no tea would be considered a
   good one if it did not include at least one kind of cake", before
   adding "as well as cakes, biscuits are much eaten at
   tea-time".^[170]^[171] Orwell included his own recipe for marmalade, a
   popular British spread on toast.^[170] However, the British Council
   declined to publish the essay on the grounds that it was too
   problematic to write about food at the time of strict rationing in the
   UK following the war. In 2019, the essay was discovered in the British
   Council's archives along with the rejection letter. The British Council
   issued an official apology to Orwell over the rejection of the
   commissioned essay, publishing the original essay along with the
   rejection letter.^[170]

Personal life

Childhood

   Jacintha Buddicom's account, Eric & Us, provides an insight into
   Blair's childhood.^[172] She quoted his sister Avril that "he was
   essentially an aloof, undemonstrative person" and said herself of his
   friendship with the Buddicoms: "I do not think he needed any other
   friends beyond the schoolfriend he occasionally and appreciatively
   referred to as 'CC'". She could not recall him having schoolfriends to
   stay and exchange visits as her brother Prosper often did in
   holidays.^[173] Cyril Connolly provides an account of Blair as a child
   in Enemies of Promise.^[174] Years later, Blair mordantly recalled his
   prep school in the essay "Such, Such Were the Joys", claiming among
   other things that he "was made to study like a dog" to earn a
   scholarship. Jacintha Buddicom repudiated Orwell's schoolboy misery
   described in the essay, stating that "he was a specially happy child".
   She noted that he did not like his name because it reminded him of a
   book he greatly disliked—Eric, or, Little by Little, a Victorian boys'
   school story.^[175]
   A large gothic facade Orwell's time at Eton College was formative in
   his attitude and his later career as a writer.

   Connolly remarked of him as a schoolboy, "The remarkable thing about
   Orwell was that alone among the boys he was an intellectual and not a
   parrot for he thought for himself".^[174] At Eton, John Vaughan Wilkes,
   his former headmaster's son at St Cyprians, recalled that "he was
   extremely argumentative—about anything—and criticising the masters and
   criticising the other boys [...] We enjoyed arguing with him. He would
   generally win the arguments—or think he had anyhow."^[176]

   Blair liked to carry out practical jokes. Buddicom recalls him swinging
   from the luggage rack in a railway carriage like an orangutan to
   frighten a woman passenger out of the compartment.^[20] At Eton, he
   played tricks on John Crace, his housemaster, among which was to enter
   a spoof advertisement in a college magazine implying pederasty.^[177]
   Gow, his tutor, said he "made himself as big a nuisance as he could"
   and "was a very unattractive boy".^[178] Later Blair was expelled from
   the crammer at Southwold for sending a dead rat as a birthday present
   to the town surveyor.^[179]

   Blair had an interest in natural history which stemmed from his
   childhood. In letters from school he wrote about caterpillars and
   butterflies,^[180] and Buddicom recalls his keen interest in
   ornithology. He also enjoyed fishing and shooting rabbits, and
   conducting experiments as in cooking a hedgehog^[20] or shooting down a
   jackdaw from the Eton roof to dissect it.^[181] His zeal for scientific
   experiments extended to explosives—again Buddicom recalls a cook giving
   notice because of the noise. Later in Southwold, his sister Avril
   recalled him blowing up the garden. When teaching he enthused his
   students with his nature-rambles both at Southwold^[182] and at
   Hayes.^[183] His adult diaries are permeated with his observations on
   nature.

Relationships and marriage

   Blair's adolescent idyll with Buddicom was shattered in the summer of
   1921, when he attempted to take their relationship further than
   Buddicom was ready for, in what was characterised as a botched
   seduction.^[184] When Blair left for Burma the following year, he wrote
   to Buddicom but she soon stopped replying to his letters.^[185]
   Returning from Burma in 1927, Blair went in search of Buddicom at her
   family home to ask her to marry him but could not find her.^[186] What
   had been a very serious business indeed for Blair had apparently been
   dismissed by Buddicom, leaving Blair potentially emotionally
   vulnerable.^[21] Buddicom and Blair revisited those memories briefly in
   1949 in three letters and three telephone calls but without
   closure.^[187]

   Mabel Fierz, who later became Blair's confidante, said: "He used to say
   the one thing he wished in this world was that he'd been attractive to
   women. He liked women and had many girlfriends I think in Burma. He had
   a girl in Southwold and another girl in London. He was rather a
   womaniser, yet he was afraid he wasn't attractive."^[188]

   Brenda Salkield (Southwold) preferred friendship to any deeper
   relationship and maintained a correspondence with Blair for many years,
   particularly as a sounding board for his ideas. She wrote: "He was a
   great letter writer. Endless letters, and I mean when he wrote you a
   letter he wrote pages."^[25] His correspondence with Eleanor Jacques
   (London) was more prosaic, dwelling on a closer relationship and
   referring to past rendezvous or planning future ones in London and
   Burnham Beeches.^[189]
   [250px-Richard_Blair_1.jpg] Orwell's adopted son Richard in 2018
   reciting his father's work at his graveside during an annual visit to
   All Saints' churchyard, Sutton Courtenay

   When Orwell was in the sanatorium in Kent, his wife Eileen's friend
   Lydia Jackson visited. He invited her for a walk and out of sight "an
   awkward situation arose."^[190] Jackson was to be the most critical of
   Orwell's marriage to Eileen, but their later correspondence hints at a
   complicity. At the time Eileen was more concerned about Orwell's
   closeness to Brenda Salkield. Orwell had an affair with his secretary
   at Tribune which caused Eileen much distress, and others have been
   mooted. In a letter to Ann Popham he wrote: "I was sometimes unfaithful
   to Eileen, and I also treated her badly, and I think she treated me
   badly, too, at times, but it was a real marriage, in the sense that we
   had been through awful struggles together and she understood all about
   my work, etc."^[191] Similarly he suggested to Celia Kirwan that they
   had both been unfaithful.^[192] There are several testaments that it
   was a well-matched and happy marriage.^[193]^[194]^[195]

   In June 1944, Orwell and Eileen adopted a three-week-old boy they named
   Richard Horatio.^[196] According to Richard, Orwell was a wonderful
   father who gave him devoted, if rather rugged, attention and a great
   degree of freedom.^[197]

   Orwell was very lonely after Eileen's death in 1945 and was desperate
   for a wife, both as companion for himself and as mother for Richard. He
   proposed marriage to four women, including Celia Kirwan, and eventually
   Sonia Brownell accepted.^[198] Orwell had met her when she was
   assistant to Cyril Connolly, at Horizon literary magazine.^[199] They
   were married on 13 October 1949, only three months before Orwell's
   death. Some maintain that Sonia was the model for Julia in Nineteen
   Eighty-Four.

Social interactions

   Orwell was noted for very close and enduring friendships with a few
   friends, but these were generally people with a similar background or
   with a similar level of literary ability. Ungregarious, he was out of
   place in a crowd and his discomfort was exacerbated when he was outside
   his own class. Though representing himself as a spokesman for the
   common man, he often appeared out of place with real working people.
   His brother-in-law Humphrey Dakin, a "Hail fellow, well met" type, who
   took him to a local pub in Leeds, said that he was told by the
   landlord: "Don't bring that bugger in here again."^[200]

   Adrian Fierz commented "He wasn't interested in racing or greyhounds or
   pub crawling or shove ha'penny. He just did not have much in common
   with people who did not share his intellectual interests."^[201]
   Awkwardness attended many of his encounters with working-class
   representatives, as with Pollitt and McNair,^[202] but his courtesy and
   good manners were often commented on. Jack Common observed on meeting
   him for the first time, "Right away manners, and more than
   manners—breeding—showed through."^[203]

   In his tramping days, he did domestic work for a time. His extreme
   politeness was recalled by a member of the family he worked for; she
   declared that the family referred to him as "Laurel" after the film
   comedian.^[51] With his gangling figure and awkwardness, Orwell's
   friends often saw him as a figure of fun. Geoffrey Gorer commented "He
   was awfully likely to knock things off tables, trip over things. I
   mean, he was a gangling, physically badly co-ordinated young man. I
   think his feeling [was] that even the inanimate world was against
   him."^[204] At the BBC in the 1940s, "everybody would pull his
   leg"^[205] and Spender described him as having real entertainment value
   "like, as I say, watching a Charlie Chaplin movie".^[206] A friend of
   Eileen's reminisced about her tolerance and humour, often at Orwell's
   expense.^[194]

   One biography of Orwell accused him of having had an authoritarian
   streak.^[207] One of his former pupils recalled being beaten so hard he
   could not sit down for a week.^[208] When sharing a flat with Orwell,
   Heppenstall came home late one night in an advanced stage of loud
   inebriation. The upshot was that Heppenstall ended up with a bloody
   nose and was locked in a room. When he complained, Orwell hit him
   across the legs with a shooting stick and Heppenstall then had to
   defend himself with a chair. Years later, after Orwell's death,
   Heppenstall wrote a dramatic account of the incident called "The
   Shooting Stick".^[209]

   Orwell got on well with young people. The pupil he beat considered him
   the best of teachers and the young recruits in Barcelona tried to drink
   him under the table without success.^[193]

   In the wake of his most famous works, he attracted many uncritical
   hangers-on, but many others who sought him found him aloof and even
   dull. With his soft voice, he was sometimes shouted down or excluded
   from discussions.^[210] At this time, he was severely ill; it was
   wartime or the austerity period after it; during the war his wife
   suffered from depression; and after her death he was lonely and
   unhappy. In addition to that, he always lived frugally and seemed
   unable to care for himself properly. As a result of all this, people
   found his circumstances bleak.^[211] Some, like Michael Ayrton, called
   him "Gloomy George", but others developed the idea that he was an
   "English secular saint".^[212]

Lifestyle

   Orwell was a heavy smoker, who rolled his own cigarettes from strong
   shag tobacco, despite his bronchial condition. His penchant for the
   rugged life often took him to cold and damp situations. Described by
   The Economist as "perhaps the 20th century's best chronicler of English
   culture",^[213] Orwell considered fish and chips, football, the pub,
   strong tea, cut-price chocolate, the movies, and radio among the chief
   comforts for the working class.^[214] He advocated a patriotic defence
   of a British way of life that could not be trusted to intellectuals or,
   by implication, the state:^[215]

     We are a nation of flower-lovers, but also a nation of
     stamp-collectors, pigeon-fanciers, amateur carpenters,
     coupon-snippers, darts-players, crossword-puzzle fans. All the
     culture that is most truly native centres round things which even
     when they are communal are not official—the pub, the football match,
     the back garden, the fireside and the "nice cup of tea". The liberty
     of the individual is still believed in, almost as in the nineteenth
     century. But this has nothing to do with economic liberty, the right
     to exploit others for profit. It is the liberty to have a home of
     your own, to do what you like in your spare time, to choose your own
     amusements instead of having them chosen for you from above.

     By putting the tea in first and stirring as one pours, one can
     exactly regulate the amount of milk, whereas one is likely to put in
     too much milk if one does it the other way round.

   One of Orwell's eleven rules for making tea from his essay "A Nice Cup
   of Tea", which appeared in the London Evening Standard, 12 January
   1946^[216]

   Orwell enjoyed strong tea—he had Fortnum & Mason's tea brought to him
   in Catalonia.^[11] His 1946 essay "A Nice Cup of Tea", appeared in the
   London Evening Standard article on how to make tea.^[217] He
   appreciated English beer, taken regularly and moderately, despised
   drinkers of lager,^[218] and wrote about an imagined, ideal British pub
   in his 1946 Evening Standard article "The Moon Under Water".^[219] Not
   as particular about food, he enjoyed the wartime "Victory Pie"^[220]
   and extolled canteen food at the BBC.^[205] He preferred traditional
   English dishes, such as roast beef, and kippers.^[221]

   His dress sense was unpredictable and usually casual.^[222] In
   Southwold, he had the best cloth from the local tailor,^[223] but was
   equally happy in his tramping outfit. His attire in the Spanish Civil
   War, along with his size-12 boots, was a source of
   amusement.^[224]^[225] David Astor described him as looking like a prep
   school master,^[226]^[full citation needed] while according to the
   Special Branch dossier, Orwell's tendency to dress "in Bohemian
   fashion" revealed that the author was "a Communist".^[227]

   Orwell's confusing approach to matters of social decorum—on the one
   hand expecting a working-class guest to dress for dinner^[228] and, on
   the other, slurping tea out of a saucer at the BBC canteen^[229]—helped
   stoke his reputation as an English eccentric.^[230]

Views

Religion

   A small row of gravestones Orwell was an atheist and a robust critic of
   Christianity. Nevertheless, he was sentimentally attached to church
   services, and was buried in All Saints' parish churchyard in Sutton
   Courtenay, Oxfordshire.

   Orwell was an atheist who identified himself with the humanist outlook
   on life.^[231] Despite this, and despite his criticisms of both
   religious doctrine and religious organisations, he nevertheless
   regularly participated in the social and civic life of the church,
   including by attending Church of England Holy Communion.^[232]
   Acknowledging this contradiction, he once said: "It seems rather mean
   to go to HC [Holy Communion] when one doesn't believe, but I have
   passed myself off for pious & there is nothing for it but to keep up
   with the deception."^[233] He had two Anglican marriages and left
   instructions for an Anglican funeral.^[234] Orwell was also well-read
   in Biblical literature and could quote lengthy passages from the Book
   of Common Prayer from memory.^[235]

   His extensive knowledge of the Bible came coupled with unsparing
   criticism of its philosophy, and as an adult he could not bring himself
   to believe in its tenets. He said in part V of his essay, "Such, Such
   Were the Joys", that "Till about the age of fourteen I believed in God,
   and believed that the accounts given of him were true. But I was well
   aware that I did not love him."^[236] Orwell directly contrasted
   Christianity with secular humanism in his essay "Lear, Tolstoy and the
   Fool", finding the latter philosophy more palatable and less
   "self-interested". The literary critic James Wood wrote that in the
   struggle, as he saw it, between Christianity and humanism, "Orwell was
   on the humanist side, of course".^[237]

   Orwell's writing was often explicitly critical of religion, and
   Christianity in particular. He found the church to be a "selfish [...]
   church of the landed gentry" with its establishment "out of touch" with
   the majority of its communicants and altogether a pernicious influence
   on public life.^[238] His contradictory and sometimes ambiguous views
   about the social benefits of religious affiliation mirrored the
   dichotomies between his public and private lives: Stephen Ingle wrote
   that it was as if the writer George Orwell "vaunted" his unbelief while
   Eric Blair the individual retained "a deeply ingrained
   religiosity".^[239]

Politics

   Orwell liked to provoke arguments by challenging the status quo, but he
   was also a traditionalist with a love of old English values. He
   criticised and satirised, from the inside, the various social milieux
   in which he found himself. In his Adelphi days, he described himself as
   a "Tory-anarchist".^[240]^[241] Of colonialism in Burmese Days, he
   portrays the English colonists as a "dull, decent people, cherishing
   and fortifying their dullness behind a quarter of a million
   bayonets".^[242] Writing for Le Progrès Civique, Orwell described the
   British colonial government in Burma and India:^[243]

     The government of all the Indian provinces under the control of the
     British Empire is of necessity despotic, because only the threat of
     force can subdue a population of several million subjects. But this
     despotism is latent. It hides behind a mask of democracy... Care is
     taken to avoid technical and industrial training. This rule,
     observed throughout India, aims to stop India from becoming an
     industrial country capable of competing with England ... Foreign
     competition is prevented by an insuperable barrier of prohibitive
     customs tariffs. And so the English factory-owners, with nothing to
     fear, control the markets absolutely and reap exorbitant profits.

   The letters "ISLP" in white on a red circle Orwell joined the British
   Independent Labour Party during his time in the Spanish Civil War and
   became a defender of democratic socialism and a critic of
   totalitarianism for the rest of his life.

   The Spanish Civil War played the most important part in defining
   Orwell's socialism. He wrote to Cyril Connolly from Barcelona on 8 June
   1937: "I have seen wonderful things and at last really believe in
   Socialism, which I never did before."^[244]^[245] Having witnessed
   anarcho-syndicalist communities and the subsequent brutal suppression
   of the anarcho-syndicalists, anti-Stalin communist parties and
   revolutionaries by the Soviet Union-backed Communists, Orwell returned
   from Catalonia a staunch anti-Stalinist and joined the British
   Independent Labour Party.^[246]

   In Part 2 of The Road to Wigan Pier, published by the Left Book Club,
   Orwell stated that "a real Socialist is one who wishes—not merely
   conceives it as desirable, but actively wishes—to see tyranny
   overthrown." Orwell stated in "Why I Write" (1946): "Every line of
   serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly
   or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as
   I understand it."^[247] Orwell's conception of socialism was of a
   planned economy alongside democracy.^[248]^[page needed] Orwell was a
   proponent of a federal socialist Europe, a position outlined in his
   1947 essay "Toward European Unity", which first appeared in Partisan
   Review. According to biographer John Newsinger:^[90]

     The other crucial dimension to Orwell's socialism was his
     recognition that the Soviet Union was not socialist. Unlike many on
     the left, instead of abandoning socialism once he discovered the
     full horror of Stalinist rule in the Soviet Union, Orwell abandoned
     the Soviet Union and instead remained a socialist—indeed he became
     more committed to the socialist cause than ever.

   Orwell was opposed to rearmament against Nazi Germany and at the time
   of the Munich Agreement signed a manifesto entitled "If War Comes We
   Shall Resist,"^[249]—but he changed his view after the
   Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and the outbreak of the war. He left the ILP
   because of its opposition to the war and adopted a political position
   of "revolutionary patriotism." On 21 March 1940 Orwell wrote a review
   of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf for The New English Weekly, in which he
   analysed the dictator's psychology. Asking "how was it that he was able
   to put [his] monstrous vision across?," Orwell tried to understand why
   Hitler was worshipped by the German people:^[250]

     The situation in Germany, with its seven million unemployed, was
     obviously favourable for demagogues. But Hitler could not have
     succeeded against his many rivals if it had not been for the
     attraction of his own personality, which one can feel even in the
     clumsy writing of Mein Kampf, and which is no doubt overwhelming
     when one hears his speeches ... The fact is that there is something
     deeply appealing about him. The initial, personal cause of his
     grievance against the universe can only be guessed at; but at any
     rate the grievance is here. He is the martyr, the victim, Prometheus
     chained to the rock, the self-sacrificing hero who fights
     single-handed against impossible odds. If he were killing a mouse he
     would know how to make it seem like a dragon.

   In December 1940 he wrote in Tribune, the Labour left's weekly: "We are
   in a strange period of history in which a revolutionary has to be a
   patriot and a patriot has to be a revolutionary." During the war,
   Orwell was highly critical of the popular idea that an Anglo-Soviet
   alliance would be the basis of a post-war world of peace and
   prosperity.^[251] In his reply, dated 15 November 1945, to an
   invitation from the Duchess of Atholl to speak for the British League
   for European Freedom, he stated that he could not "associate himself
   with an essentially Conservative body" that claimed to "defend
   democracy in Europe" but had "nothing to say about British
   imperialism". His closing paragraph stated: "I belong to the Left and
   must work inside it, much as I hate Russian totalitarianism and its
   poisonous influence in this country."^[252]

   Orwell joined the staff of Tribune magazine as literary editor, and
   from then until his death, was a left-wing (though hardly orthodox)
   Labour-supporting democratic socialist.^[253] On 1 September 1944,
   writing about the Warsaw uprising, Orwell expressed in Tribune his
   hostility against the influence of the alliance with the USSR over the
   allies: "Do remember that dishonesty and cowardice always have to be
   paid for. Do not imagine that for years on end you can make yourself
   the boot-licking propagandist of the sovietic regime, or any other
   regime, and then suddenly return to honesty and reason. Once a whore,
   always a whore."^[254] According to Newsinger, although Orwell "was
   always critical of the 1945–51 Labour government's moderation, his
   support for it began to pull him to the right politically. This did not
   lead him to embrace conservatism, imperialism or reaction, but to
   defend, albeit critically, Labour reformism."^[255]

   Special Branch, the intelligence division of the Metropolitan Police,
   maintained a file on Orwell for more than 20 years of his life. The
   dossier, published by The National Archives, states that, according to
   one investigator, Orwell had "advanced Communist views and several of
   his Indian friends say that they have often seen him at Communist
   meetings".^[256] MI5, the intelligence department of the Home Office,
   noted: "It is evident from his recent writings—'The Lion and the
   Unicorn'—and his contribution to Gollancz's symposium The Betrayal of
   the Left that he does not hold with the Communist Party nor they with
   him."^[257]

Sexuality

   Sexual politics plays an important role in Nineteen Eighty-Four. In the
   novel, people's intimate relationships are strictly governed by the
   party's Junior Anti-Sex League, by opposing sexual relations and
   instead encouraging artificial insemination.^[258] Personally, Orwell
   disliked what he thought as misguided middle-class revolutionary
   emancipatory views, expressing disdain for "every fruit-juice drinker,
   nudist, sandal-wearer, sex-maniacs".^[259]

   Orwell was also openly against homosexuality. Daphne Patai said: "Of
   course he was homophobic. That has nothing to do with his relations
   with his homosexual friends. Certainly, he had a negative attitude and
   a certain kind of anxiety, a denigrating attitude towards
   homosexuality. That is definitely the case. I think his writing
   reflects that quite fully."^[260]

   Orwell used the homophobic epithets "nancy" and "pansy", for example,
   in expressions of contempt for what he called the "pansy Left".^[261]
   The protagonist of Keep the Aspidistra Flying, Gordon Comstock,
   conducts an internal critique of his customers when working in a
   bookshop, and there is an extended passage of several pages in which he
   concentrates on a gay male customer, sneering at him for his "nancy"
   characteristics, including rhotacism.^[262] Stephen Spender "thought
   Orwell's occasional homophobic outbursts were part of his rebellion
   against the public school".^[263]

Legacy

Reception and evaluations of Orwell's works

   [250px-The_Playhouse_1984_London_Cinema_Marquee.jpg] A production of
   the play 1984 at the Playhouse Theatre in the West End. Orwell's works
   have been adapted for stage, screen and television. They have also
   inspired commercials and songs, and he is often quoted. Historian John
   Rodden called him a "cultural icon".^[264]

   Arthur Koestler said that Orwell's "uncompromising intellectual honesty
   made him appear almost inhuman at times".^[265] Ben Wattenberg stated:
   "Orwell's writing pierced intellectual hypocrisy wherever he found
   it."^[3] According to historian Piers Brendon, "Orwell was the saint of
   common decency who would in earlier days, said his BBC boss Rushbrook
   Williams, 'have been either canonised—or burnt at the stake'".^[266]
   Raymond Williams in Politics and Letters: Interviews with New Left
   Review describes Orwell as a "successful impersonation of a plain man
   who bumps into experience in an unmediated way and tells the truth
   about it".^[267]

   Christopher Norris declared that Orwell's "homespun empiricist
   outlook—his assumption that the truth was just there to be told in a
   straightforward common-sense way—now seems not merely naïve but
   culpably self-deluding".^[268] The American scholar Scott Lucas has
   described Orwell as an enemy of the Left.^[269] John Newsinger has
   argued that Lucas could only do this by portraying "all of Orwell's
   attacks on Stalinism [–] as if they were attacks on socialism, despite
   Orwell's continued insistence that they were not".^[270]

   Orwell's work has taken a prominent place in the school literature
   curriculum in England,^[271] with Animal Farm a regular examination
   topic at the end of secondary education (GCSE), and Nineteen
   Eighty-Four a topic for subsequent examinations below university level
   (A Levels). A 2016 UK poll saw Animal Farm ranked the nation's
   favourite book from school.^[272]

   The historian John Rodden stated: "John Podhoretz did claim that if
   Orwell were alive today, he'd be standing with the neo-conservatives
   and against the Left. And the question arises, to what extent can you
   even begin to predict the political positions of somebody who's been
   dead three decades and more by that time?"^[3]

   Rodden notes the "undeniable conservative features in the Orwell
   physiognomy" and remarks on how "to some extent Orwell facilitated the
   kinds of uses and abuses by the Right that his name has been put to. In
   other ways there has been the politics of selective quotation."^[3]
   Rodden refers to the essay "Why I Write",^[247] in which Orwell refers
   to the Spanish Civil War as being his "watershed political experience",
   saying: "The Spanish War and other events in 1936–37, turned the scale.
   Thereafter I knew where I stood. Every line of serious work that I have
   written since 1936 has been written directly or indirectly against
   totalitarianism and for democratic socialism as I understand it."
   (emphasis in original)^[3] Rodden goes on to explain how, during the
   McCarthy era, the introduction to the Signet edition of Animal Farm
   makes use of selective quotation:^[3]

     [Introduction]: If the book itself, Animal Farm, had left any doubt
     of the matter, Orwell dispelled it in his essay Why I Write: "Every
     line of serious work that I've written since 1936 has been written
     directly or indirectly against Totalitarianism ...."

     [Rodden]: dot, dot, dot, dot, the politics of ellipsis. "For
     Democratic Socialism" is vaporized, just like Winston Smith did it
     at the Ministry of Truth, and that's very much what happened at the
     beginning of the McCarthy era and just continued, Orwell being
     selectively quoted.

   Fyvel wrote about Orwell:^[273]^[274]

     His crucial experience [...] was his struggle to turn himself into a
     writer, one which led through long periods of poverty, failure and
     humiliation, and about which he has written almost nothing directly.
     The sweat and agony was less in the slum-life than in the effort to
     turn the experience into literature.

   Conversely, the historian Isaac Deutscher was far more critical of
   Orwell from a Marxist perspective and characterised him as a "simple
   minded anarchist". Deutscher argued that Orwell had struggled to
   comprehend the dialectical philosophy of Marxism, demonstrated personal
   ambivalence towards other strands of socialism and his works such as
   Nineteen Eighty-Four had been appropriated for the purpose of
   anti-communist Cold War propaganda.^[275]^[276]

Influence on language and writing

   In his essay "Politics and the English Language" (1946), Orwell wrote
   about the importance of precise and clear language, arguing that vague
   writing can be used as a powerful tool of political manipulation. In
   that essay, Orwell provides six rules for writers:^[277]

    1. Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you
       are used to seeing in print.
    2. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
    3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
    4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.
    5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if
       you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
    6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright
       barbarous.

   Orwell worked as a journalist at The Observer for seven years, and its
   editor David Astor gave a copy of this celebrated essay to every new
   recruit.^[278] In 2003, the literary editor at the newspaper Robert
   McCrum wrote: "Even now, it is quoted in our style book."^[278] The
   journalist Jonathan Heawood noted: "Orwell's criticism of slovenly
   language is still taken very seriously."^[278]

   Andrew N. Rubin argues that "Orwell claimed that we should be attentive
   to how the use of language has limited our capacity for critical
   thought just as we should be equally concerned with the ways in which
   dominant modes of thinking have reshaped the very language that we
   use."^[279]

   The adjective "Orwellian" connotes an attitude and a policy of control
   by propaganda, surveillance, misinformation, denial of truth and
   manipulation of the past. In Nineteen Eighty-Four, Orwell described a
   totalitarian government that controlled thought by controlling
   language, making certain ideas literally unthinkable. Several words and
   phrases from Nineteen Eighty-Four have entered popular language.
   "Newspeak" is a simplified and obfuscatory language designed to make
   independent thought impossible.^[4]^[5]

   "Doublethink" means holding two contradictory beliefs simultaneously.
   The "Thought Police" are those who suppress all dissenting opinion.
   "Prolefeed" is homogenised, manufactured superficial literature, film
   and music used to control and indoctrinate the populace through
   docility. "Big Brother" is a supreme dictator who watches everyone.
   Other neologisms from the novel include, "Two Minutes Hate", "Room
   101", "memory hole", "unperson", and "thoughtcrime",^[4]^[5] as well as
   providing direct inspiration for the neologism "groupthink".

   Orwell may have been the first to use the term "cold war" in his essay,
   "You and the Atom Bomb", published in Tribune on 19 October 1945. He
   wrote:^[280]

     We may be heading not for general breakdown but for an epoch as
     horribly stable as the slave empires of antiquity. James Burnham's
     theory has been much discussed, but few people have yet considered
     its ideological implications—this is, the kind of world-view, the
     kind of beliefs, and the social structure that would probably
     prevail in a State which was at once unconquerable and in a
     permanent state of "cold war" with its neighbours.

   In 1965 the Marxist cultural studies critic Raymond Williams (the
   author of Keywords) considered Orwell's concept of freedom and his
   writings in a review of books by Christopher Caudwell, who unlike
   Orwell (the better known writer) did not survive the Spanish Civil War.
   Williams cautions the reader "not to rest in Orwell" for "he engages
   too easily with our intellectual and emotional habits... can reinforce
   a prejudice, delay recognition of a muddle, betray us emotionally at a
   point of new growth..."^[281]

Modern culture

   [250px-Society_Publications.jpg] A selection of publications by the
   Orwell Society

   In 2011, The Orwell Society was formed to promote understanding of the
   life and work of Orwell.^[282] Orwell's birthplace, a bungalow in
   Motihari, Bihar, India, was opened as a museum in May 2015.^[283]

   Apart from theatre adaptations of his books, several works were written
   with Orwell as one of the main characters.
     * In 2012 a musical play, One Georgie Orwell, by Peter Cordwell and
       Carl Picton was performed at the Greenwich Theatre, London. It
       explored Orwell's life, his concerns for the world that he lived
       in, and for the Britain that he loved.^[284]
     * In 2014 a play by the playwright Joe Sutton titled Orwell in
       America was first performed by the Northern Stage theatre company
       in White River Junction, Vermont. It is a fictitious account of
       Orwell doing a book tour in the United States (something he never
       did in his lifetime). It moved to off-Broadway in 2016.^[285]
     * In 2017 Mrs Orwell by the British playwright Tony Cox opened at the
       Old Red Lion Theatre in London before transferring to the Southwark
       Playhouse.^[286] The play centres on Orwell's second wife Sonia
       Brownell (played by Cressida Bonas), her reasons for marrying
       Orwell and her relationship with Lucian Freud.
     * In 2019, Tasmanian theatre company Blue Cow presented the play 101
       by Cameron Hindrum,^[287] in which Orwell is seen working on his
       novel 1984 "while keeping his severe illness at bay and balancing
       the demands of fatherhood, art, family and success".^[288]
     * Orwell is the main character in a 2017 novel The Last Man in Europe
       by the Australian author Dennis Glover.^[289]
     * The young Eric Blair is the main character in Paul Theroux's 2024
       novel Burma Sahib, a fictional narrative of Blair's five years in
       the country.^[290]

Archive

   In 1960 Orwell's widow Sonia deposited his papers on permanent loan to
   University College London.^[291] The collection contains Orwell's
   literary notebooks, manuscripts and typescripts of his work, personal
   and political diaries, correspondence and family material.^[291] Since
   the initial donation the papers – now known as the George Orwell
   Archive – have been supplemented by further donations from family,
   friends and business associates.^[291] Orwell's son Richard Blair has
   purchased additional material for the collection since its inception;
   in 2023 Blair was awarded an Honorary Fellowship from University
   College London for his contributions.^[292]^[293]

   University College London also holds an extensive collection of
   Orwell's books, including rare and early editions of his works,
   translations into other languages and titles from his own
   library.^[294]

Statue

   statue of George Orwell outside Broadcasting House, headquarters of the
   BBC

   A statue of George Orwell, sculpted by the British sculptor Martin
   Jennings, was unveiled on 7 November 2017 outside Broadcasting House,
   the headquarters of the BBC.^[n 4] The wall behind the statue is
   inscribed with the following phrase: "If liberty means anything at all,
   it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear". These
   are words from his proposed preface to Animal Farm and a rallying cry
   for the idea of free speech in an open society.^[295]^[296]

Other honours

   In January 2025 the Royal Mint issued a new £2 coin to mark the 75th
   anniversary of Orwell's death. The design, by Henry Gray, is an
   allusion to Nineteen Eighty-Four, showing an eye with a camera lens at
   its centre, and including two quotations from the book.^[297]

Biographies

   Orwell's will requested that no biography of him be written, and his
   widow, Sonia Brownell, repelled every attempt by those who tried to
   persuade her to let them write about him. Various recollections and
   interpretations were published in the 1950s and 1960s, but Sonia saw
   the 1968 Collected Works^[298]^[299] as the record of his life. She did
   appoint Malcolm Muggeridge as official biographer, but later
   biographers have seen this as deliberate spoiling as Muggeridge
   eventually gave up the work.^[300] In 1972, two American authors, Peter
   Stansky and William Abrahams, produced The Unknown Orwell, an
   unauthorised account of his early years that lacked any support or
   contribution from Sonia Brownell.^[301]

   Sonia Brownell then commissioned Bernard Crick to complete a biography
   and asked Orwell's friends to co-operate.^[302] Crick collated a
   considerable amount of material in his work, which was published in
   1980,^[302] but his questioning of the factual accuracy of Orwell's
   first-person writings led to conflict with Brownell, and she tried to
   suppress the book. Crick concentrated on the facts of Orwell's life
   rather than his character, and presented primarily a political
   perspective.^[303]

   After Sonia Brownell's death, other works on Orwell were published in
   the 1980s, particularly in 1984. These included collections of
   reminiscences by Audrey Coppard and Crick^[179]^[299] and Stephen
   Wadhams.^[25]^[304] In 1991, Michael Shelden published a
   biography.^[32]^[305] More concerned with the literary nature of
   Orwell's work, he sought explanations for Orwell's character and
   treated his first-person writings as autobiographical. Shelden
   introduced new information that sought to build on Crick's work.^[302]

   Peter Davison's publication of the Complete Works of George Orwell,
   completed in 2000,^[306]^[307] made most of the Orwell Archive
   accessible to the public. Jeffrey Meyers, a prolific American
   biographer, was first to take advantage of this and published a book in
   2001 that investigated the darker side of Orwell and questioned his
   saintly image.^[302] Why Orwell Matters (released in the UK as Orwell's
   Victory) was published by Christopher Hitchens in 2002.^[308]

   In 2003, the centenary of Orwell's birth resulted in biographies by
   Gordon Bowker^[309] and D.J. Taylor.^[310] Taylor notes the stage
   management which surrounds much of Orwell's behaviour^[11] and Bowker
   highlights the essential sense of decency which he considers to have
   been Orwell's main motivation.^[311] An updated edition of Taylor's
   biography was released in 2023 as Orwell: The New Life, published by
   Constable.^[312]^[313]

   In 2018, Ronald Binns published the first detailed study of Orwell's
   years in Suffolk, Orwell in Southwold. In 2020, Richard Bradford wrote
   a new biography, Orwell: A Man of Our Time,^[314] while in 2021 Rebecca
   Solnit reflected on Orwell's interest in gardening in her book Orwell's
   Roses.^[315]

   Two books about Orwell's relationship with his first wife, Eileen
   O'Shaughnessy, and her role in his life and career, have been
   published: Eileen: The Making of George Orwell by Sylvia Topp
   (2020)^[316] and Wifedom: Mrs Orwell's Invisible Life by Anna Funder
   (2023).^[317]^[310] In her book Funder claims that Orwell was
   misogynistic and sadistic. This sparked a strong controversy among
   Orwell's biographers, particularly with Topp. Celia Kirwan's family
   also intervened in the discussion, believing that the attribution to
   their relative of a relationship with Orwell, as stated by Funder, is
   false. The publishing house of Wifedom was forced to remove that
   reference from the book.^[318]

Notes

    1. ^ Stansky and Abrahams suggested that Ida Blair moved to England in
       1907, based on information given by her daughter Avril, talking
       about a time before she was born. This is contrasted by Ida Blair's
       1905, as well as a photograph of Eric, aged three, in an English
       suburban garden.^[12] The earlier date coincides with a difficult
       posting for Blair senior, and the need to start their daughter
       Marjorie (then six years old) in an English education.
    2. ^ The conventional view, based on Geoffrey Gorer's recollections,
       is of a specific commission with a £500 advance. Taylor argues that
       Orwell's subsequent life does not suggest he received such a large
       advance, Gollancz was not known to pay large sums to relatively
       unknown authors, and Gollancz took little proprietorial interest in
       progress.^[68]
    3. ^ The author states that evidence discovered at the National
       Historical Archives in Madrid in 1989 of a security police report
       to the Tribunal for Espionage and High Treason described Eric Blair
       and his wife Eileen Blair, as "known Trotskyists" and as "linking
       agents of the ILP and the POUM". Newsinger goes on to state that
       given Orwell's precarious health, "there can be little doubt that
       if he had been arrested he would have died in prison".
    4. ^ The statue is owned by The Orwell Society under the patronage of
       Richard Blair, Orwell's adopted son.

   Slab. St. Augustines Press. ISBN 978-1587316104. "For Orwell, socialism
   is a planned society by definition, as contrasted with capitalism,
   which is by definition unplanned. So closely was socialism identified
   with planning that socialists would sometimes use a phrase like 'a
   planned society' as a synonym for socialism, and Orwell himself does
   this too ... Democracy too is part of Orwell's picture of socialism,
   though when he employs the term 'democracy', he is usually referring to
   civil liberties rather than to decisions by majority vote—not that he
   rejects majoritarian rule, but that when he talks about 'democracy,'
   this is not uppermost in his mind."
