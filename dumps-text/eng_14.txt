   Alternative cultures that differ from the mainstream
   For other uses, see Underground culture (disambiguation).

   Underground culture, or simply underground, is a term to describe
   various alternative cultures which either consider themselves different
   from the mainstream of society and culture, or are considered so by
   others. The word "underground" is used because there is a history of
   resistance movements under harsh regimes where the term underground was
   employed to refer to the necessary secrecy of the resisters.

   For example, the Underground Railroad was a network of clandestine
   routes by which African slaves in the 19th-century United States
   attempted to escape to freedom. The phrase "underground railroad" was
   resurrected and applied in the 1960s to the extensive network of draft
   counseling groups and houses used to help Vietnam War-era draft dodgers
   escape to Canada,^[1] and was also applied in the 1970s to the
   clandestine movement of people and goods by the American Indian
   Movement in and out of occupied Native American reservation lands. (See
   also: Wounded Knee Occupation).^[2]

   The filmmaker Rosa von Praunheim documented the legendary New York
   underground scene in the 1970s around Andy Warhol in some of his films,
   for example in Underground and Emigrants (1976) and Tally Brown, New
   York (1979). Since then, the term has come to designate various
   subcultures such as mod culture, hippie culture, punk culture, techno
   music/rave culture, underground hip hop and also neo-nazi.

Terminology

   [edit]

   The unmodified term "The underground" was a common name for World War
   II resistance movements. It was later applied to counter-cultural
   movements, many of which sprang up in the United States during the
   1960s.

History

   [edit]

   The 1960s and 1970s underground cultural movements had some connections
   to the Beat Generation, which had, in turn, been inspired by the French
   author philosophers, artists, and poets as Louis-Ferdinand Céline or
   the Existentialist movement, which gathered around Jean-Paul Sartre and
   Albert Camus in Paris during the years that followed the aftermath of
   World War II. Sartre and Camus were members of Combat, a French
   resistance group formed in 1942 by Henri Frenay. Frenay, Sartre, and
   Camus were all involved in publishing underground newspapers for the
   resistance. The French intellectuals which inspired underground
   american author as Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs
   in North America in the 1940s was steeped in socialist thinking before
   the Cold War began.

   In the Esquire magazine (1958),^[3] Jack Kerouac stated:

     The same thing was almost going on in the postwar France of Sartre
     and Genet and what's more we knew about it—But as to the actual
     existence of a Beat Generation, chances are it was really just an
     idea in our minds—We'd stay up 24 hours drinking cup after cup of
     black coffee, playing record after record of Wardell Gray, Lester
     Young, Dexter Gordon, Willie Jackson, Lennie Tristano and all the
     rest, talking madly about that holy new feeling out there in the
     streets—We'd write stories about some strange beatific Negro hepcat
     saint with goatee hitchhiking across Iowa with taped up horn
     bringing the secret message of blowing to other coasts, other
     cities, like a veritable Walter the Penniless leading an invisible
     First Crusade—We had our mystic heroes and wrote, nay sung novels
     about them, erected long poems celebrating the new 'angels' of the
     American underground—In actuality there was only a handful of real
     hip swinging cats and what there was vanished mightily swiftly
     during the Korean War when (and after) a sinister new kind of
     efficiency appeared in America, maybe it was the result of the
     universalization of Television and nothing else (the Polite Total
     Police Control of Dragnet's 'peace' officers) but the beat
     characters after 1950 vanished into jails and madhouses, or were
     shamed into silent conformity, the generation itself was shortlived
     and small in number.

Modern day

   [edit]

   Today, many aspects of underground culture have become more accessible
   and commercialized, often losing their original spirit. Niche music
   genres, fashion styles, and art forms are now widely marketed to
   mainstream audiences, which can dilute their authenticity.

   Moreover, the ease of access to cultural products online has blurred
   the lines between underground and mainstream. Consequently, what was
   once considered "underground" is now often integrated into popular
   culture, resulting in a loss of the exclusivity and community that
   originally defined these movements.
