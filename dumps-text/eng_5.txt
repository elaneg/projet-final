   Overview of casual sex encounters without commitment

   Hookup culture is a social phenomenon that accepts and encourages
   casual sexual encounters, including one-night stands and related
   activities, without necessarily including emotional intimacy, bonding
   or a committed relationship.^[1] It is generally associated with
   Western late adolescent sexuality and, in particular, United States
   college culture.^[2]^[3]^[4] The term hookup has an ambiguous
   definition because it can indicate kissing or any form of physical
   sexual activity between sexual partners.^[5]^[6] The term has been
   widely used in the U.S. since at least 2000.^[6] It has also been
   called nonrelationship sex,^[7] or sex without dating.

   Most research on hookups has been focused on U.S. college students;
   however, it is important to note that hookups are not limited to
   college campuses.^[8]^[9] Adolescents and emerging adults engage in
   hookups for a variety of reasons, which may include from instant
   physical gratification, to fulfillment of emotional needs, to using it
   as a means of finding a long-term romantic partner.^[9] Media reaction
   to hookup culture has been often considered as a form of moral
   panic.^[10]^[11]^[12] The introduction of cell phones, mobile hookup
   apps and websites has modernized hookup culture, especially among gay
   men.^[13]

History

   [edit]

   The rise of hookups, a form of casual sex, has been described by
   evolutionary biologist Justin Garcia and others as a "cultural
   revolution" that had its beginnings in the 1920s.^[14] Historians
   D'Emilio and Freedman put the beginning of casual sex, including
   college hookups, further back in history, to the early 1800s, and
   explain the phenomenon as shaped by historical and cultural
   forces.^[15] Lisa Wade, a sociologist, documents that 19th-century
   white fraternity men often had what would be called hookup sex with
   prostitutes, poor women, and enslaved women (however, the latter is
   generally defined as rape^[citation needed]).^[16] Homosexual men also
   engaged in hookup sex during the 1800s, meeting in spaces that were
   transient in nature, such as wharves and boarding houses.^[15] Since
   the 1920s, there has been a transition from an age of courtship to an
   era of hookup culture.^[17]^[15]^[16] Technological advancements, such
   as the automobile and movie theaters, brought young couples out of
   their parents' homes, and out from their watchful eyes, giving them
   more freedom and more opportunity to engage in casual sexual
   activity.^[14]

   The sexual revolution of the 1960s brought a loosening of sexual morals
   which allowed for sex to become uncoupled from relationships and
   non-marital sex to become more socially acceptable.^[3]^[18]

   Support for sexual freedom became increasingly popular as new ideas and
   beliefs evolved about the positive and negative aspects of engaging in
   sexual intercourse.^[19] It became more widely accepted that having sex
   was not necessarily always intended for reproduction, but rather had
   more emphasis on physical pleasure.^[19] This new outlook was
   influenced by several factors, including the eradication of 1930s
   censorship laws regarding sexually explicit content in media, and also
   a growing accessibility to birth control pills, condoms, and other
   forms of contraception.^[19]^[16] Before the 1960s, unmarried women
   were usually denied access to birth control since it was traditional
   for men and women to refrain from having sex until after marriage.^[16]

   Feminism grew substantially in the 1960s, with supporters arguing that
   a woman should have complete control over her own body.^[19] Supporters
   of the feminist movement also argued that women should be able to
   "pursue" men in the same way men traditionally approached women, and
   made efforts to change the negative attitudes usually associated with
   women that decided to have sex before marriage.^[19]

   Kathleen Bogle has stated that the growing acceptance of casual sex in
   the 1960s could also be attributed to a sharp rise in female student
   enrollment at colleges and universities.^[19] The number of women
   attending college in the United States in 1972 was three times larger
   than the number in 1960.^[19]^[20] With a greater number of females on
   campuses compared to males, women had to adjust to the sexual scripts
   outlined by men, which are based more on engaging in uncommitted sex
   rather than on developing relationships.^[19]

   Some scholars, including Garcia and Freitas, have found that dating,
   while it has not disappeared, has decreased as the frequency of hookups
   have increased.^[11]^[21] By the mid-1990s, Freitas found that hookups
   were an accepted form of interactions among sexually active adults,
   especially those located on college campuses.^[1]

   According to a review by Garcia, this is "an unprecedented time in the
   history of human sexuality."^[14] People are marrying and beginning
   families at ages later than previous generations while becoming
   sexually mature at an earlier age. As a result, Garcia and other
   scholars argue that young adults are able to reproduce physiologically
   but are not psychologically or socially ready to 'settle down' and
   begin a family.^[14]

   These developmental shifts, Garcia's systematic review of the
   literature suggests, is one of the factors driving the increase in
   hookups, a "popular cultural change that has infiltrated the lives of
   emerging adults throughout the Western world."^[14] The review shows
   that hookups are becoming increasingly normative among young adults and
   adolescents in North America and have taken root throughout the Western
   world, which represents a notable shift in how casual sex is perceived
   and accepted.^[11]

   Garcia and others have noted that the "past decade has witnessed an
   explosion in interest in the topic of hookups, both scientifically and
   in the popular media. Research on hookups is not seated within a
   singular disciplinary sphere; it sits at the crossroads of theoretical
   and empirical ideas drawn from a diverse range of fields, including
   psychology, anthropology, sociology, biology, medicine, and public
   health."^[11] However, research shows that COVID-19 has impacted
   hook-up culture by lowering the prevalence of casual sex.^[22]
   Difficulties in defining the term can lead to different perceptions of
   its prevalence.^[23] Hookup culture is vaguely defined due to a variety
   of perspectives taken on this subject relating to human sexuality. It
   is hard to make sense of hookup culture without understanding why it
   exists in society and why individuals participate in the culture.^[24]

   According to Shannon T. Boodram, "hooking up is nothing more than
   settling; it is the microwaveable burrito of sex."^[24] Hooking up is
   engaged in for the instant gratification for sex, pleasure, a feeling
   of being loved, an emotional feeling of being adhered to, the thought
   of the potential of the hookup developing into something less casual,
   and many more reasons.^[24]

   According to Kathleen Bogle, the phrase 'hooking up' is "a slang term"
   deemed unofficial and unpredictable due to the extended variation of
   its meaning.^[17] Many other slang terms for hooking up were and are
   still used such as "friends with benefits" and "booty call."^[17] Other
   terms for repeated acts of hooking up include, "casual sex" or
   "recreational sex," or defined as a relationship with "no strings
   attached."^[25]

Behavioral norms

   [edit]

   The definition of hooking up can vary depending on the person or on the
   age group. It can range from acts that involve kissing, oral sex,
   manual sex, or sexual intercourse.^[26]^[27] The term "hooking up,"
   meaning an instance of casual sex, differs from hookup culture. A
   hookup is an act that involves sexual intimacy, claimed by many to be a
   sexually liberating act. On the other hand, hookup culture is thought
   to be oppressive and monolithic, with intimacy only occurring within a
   specific context.^[28] Jennifer Aubrey and Siobhan Smith have found
   that between genders there are minimal differences when it comes to
   behavior and frequency in hookups; on the other hand, women still face
   a harder social stigma, because their social status decreases with
   increased sexual partners, but men's social status increases with more
   sexual partners.^[29] There is also a difference between men and women
   when it comes to the reason to partake in casual sex. Men hook up to
   increase sexual experiences and to gain their manhood, but women tend
   to hook up with the hopes of it becoming a long-term relationship and
   to satisfy their partner.^[30] In a study conducted by Danielle M.
   Currier, she explores how the phrase "hooking up" conveys different
   meanings depending on whether a man or woman uses it when describing
   their sexual encounters; furthermore, Currier notes that men use
   "hooking up" to emphasize their masculinity and heterosexuality, but
   women use the phrase to preserve their femininity by being
   strategically ambiguous to downplay their sexual desires.^[31]

Gender roles

   [edit]

   Both men and women participate in hookups, but Bogle notes that males
   and females often choose casual sex for different reasons.^[19]
   Researchers suggest men and women have distinct sexual scripts, ways in
   which cultural influences can affect an individual's sexual
   behaviors.^[19]^[16] Furthermore, society judges the sexual behaviors
   of men and women in a completely different manner.^[19]^[16] For men,
   sex is characterized as "central to male identity," and research
   suggests men tend to "prefer nonrelational sex."^[16] In contrast,
   women are viewed as "sexual objects" and are normally "sexually passive
   compared to men."^[16] Society typically admires or glorifies men who
   frequently engage in casual sex, but women are scrutinized or
   admonished for the same behaviors.^[19] For that reason, a woman's
   sexual script has more focus on finding some type of commitment or
   relationship.^[19] Additionally, women pursue relationships to "protect
   their reputation" in college, but men have more sexual freedom without
   the fear of reproach.^[19] Women risk being called "sluts" or being
   accused of "getting around too much" since society has historically
   identified that as inappropriate behavior for women.^[19]^[32] Men are
   not held to the same standards, particularly in high school and
   college. Men who engage in regular sexual activity are seen as
   successful individuals who are "players."^[19] In fact, men are rarely
   reprimanded for their sexual behavior unless they are practicing
   abstinence in which case their peers might say that they cannot "get
   any."^[19]

   Researcher Donna Freitas challenges society's perceptions of the male
   sexual script. Through conversations and interviews with men on college
   campuses, she states that they expressed a need to "fit in" with other
   males to be successful.^[32] Men claim to hook up more because of peer
   expectations, rather than to meet their own desires.^[32] Men also say
   they cannot express disapproval for hookup culture the same way that
   women can without facing criticism from their peers.^[32] To summarize,
   women face several risks by participating in hook-up culture, but
   Freitas says "men risk gaining a reputation by not being a part of
   it."^[32]

   However, both men and women let societal pressure influence their
   sexual behavior on college campuses. Pluralistic ignorance leads people
   to behave in alignment with beliefs that they attribute to their group
   although they are usually false, regardless of the individual's
   beliefs. Research done on a college campus found that men and women
   overestimate their same-gendered peers' comfort towards hookups and act
   in accordance with their perception of how their peers feel, rather
   than their own comfort level.^[33] Pluralistic ignorance is supported
   by the results that women felt moderate discomfort with intercourse
   during a hookup, but 32% still reported participating, and all women
   rated their peers' comfort higher than their own.^[33] The study found
   that men were more comfortable with all sexual behaviors discussed than
   women were.^[33] Researchers argue that both lead to negative
   consequences like sexual assault, especially for women.^[33]

Homosexuality

   [edit]

   Stereotypes suggest most people believe that gay men are the most
   likely to engage in casual or uncommitted sex on a regular basis.^[34]
   Studies conclude that gay men participated in more frequent casual sex
   than individuals "across all genders, sexes, and sexual orientations
   comparison groups."^[34]^[35] Overall, hookup culture is understood to
   be most prominent within the gay community.^[34]^[35] Biologically
   speaking, sexual behavior is closely connected to someone's birth
   sex.^[35] Under that assumption, women are considered a "limiting
   factor in sexual encounters."^[34]^[35] Gay men do not have to question
   the sexual desires of other men like they would if a woman was involved
   in the scenario.^[34]^[35]

   Additionally, society's early negative perspectives on homosexuality
   along with a lack of "regulation" in gay relationships may explain the
   higher rate of casual sex encounters among gay men.^[34]^[35] Certain
   perceptions of gay men like prejudice and homophobia adversely affected
   the overall mental health of gay men, and they were often forced to
   explore their sexual needs and desires in a discreet fashion.^[34]^[35]

   More recent technology, such as dating websites and mobile apps, have
   also contributed to the current hookup tendencies observed in gay
   men.^[15]^[34]^[36] Apps like Grindr have further advanced the sexual
   scripts of homosexual men.^[15] Apps such as Taimi, Her and Zoe have
   advanced the sexual scripts for homosexual women. Other apps, like
   Tinder, Hinge or Bumble, have been created to follow a similar script
   for heterosexual individuals. Nevertheless, because casual hookups and
   anonymous sexual encounters have been classified as more prominent in
   homosexuals, apps like Tinder and Bumble still maintain a broader focus
   on more long-term goals like dating or relationships, especially when
   compared to apps like Grindr.^[15]

Adolescents

   [edit]

   Some North American surveys published in the mid-2000s have shown that
   upwards of 60% or 70% of sexually active teens reported having had
   uncommitted sex within the last year.^[11]^[37]^[38]^[39] That is more
   common among males than females.^[37] Among sexually experienced
   adolescents, 28% of males and 16% of females reported losing their
   virginity to either someone they have just met or to a friend who is
   not a dating partner.^[40]

   Males are more likely than females to have several hookup partners at
   the same time and to hook up with someone they are not dating.^[37] For
   both genders, hookups are more likely to be with an ex-boyfriend, an
   ex-girlfriend, or a friend than an acquaintance.^[37] The majority of
   teens (68%) who hook up with a friend or an ex will hook up with them
   again.^[37]

   About half of all hookups among adolescents were a one-time affair, and
   this is the same for both genders.^[37] Only 6% of teens have had sex
   with someone they just met, and those encounters are a one-time affair
   75% of the time.^[37] Over all, 25% of those who had a sexual
   experience with a dating partner have also hooked up with someone they
   were not dating.^[37] Additionally, 40% of those who had hooked up with
   someone they were not dating had also hooked up with a dating partner
   in the previous 12 months.^[37]

   Studies have shown that most high school girls are more interested in a
   relationship than high school boys, who are interested mostly in sex.
   Young women tend to be honest about their sexual encounters and
   experiences, and young men tend to lie more often about
   theirs.^[citation needed] Another study shows that once a person has
   sex for their first time, it becomes less of an issue to future
   relationships or hookups. The study showed that girls in high school do
   not care as much as boys do about having sex in a relationship. On the
   contrary, girls will have sex with their partner to match them.^[41]

Relationships

   [edit]

   For some adolescents, sex and relationships have been
   decoupled.^[citation needed]

   Some worry that if society disconnects intimate sexual behavior and
   emotional connection, teens who hookup will have trouble forming stable
   intimate relationships later in life.^[42]^[43]^[44]

   Journalist Sabrina Weill asserts that "casual teen attitudes toward
   sex—particularly oral sex—reflect their confusion about what is normal
   behavior" and adds that they are facing an intimacy crisis that could
   haunt them in future relationships. "When teenagers fool around before
   they're ready or have a very casual attitude toward sex, they proceed
   toward adulthood with a lack of understanding about intimacy."^[43]

College

   [edit]

   Historical research documents that white male college students have a
   long history of engaging in hookup sex.^[15]^[16] Journals and letters
   from the 1800s demonstrate that wealthy young white male college
   students hooked up with prostitutes, with poor women, and with enslaved
   African American women.

   Today, according to one study, more than 90% of American college
   students say their campus is characterized by a hookup culture,^[45]
   and students believe that about 85% of their classmates have hooked
   up.^[4] There have been several studies conducted that found men
   emerging into adulthood have a higher number of casual sex partners and
   will engage in more casual sex as opposed to women. It also seems that
   hooking up has replaced much of the dating scene on many U.S. college
   campuses, though men and women's definition of hookups varied.^[30]
   Studies show that most students (most recent data suggest between 60%
   and 80%) do have some sort of casual sex experience.^[11]^[14] Of those
   students who have hooked up, between 30% and 50% report that their
   hookups included sexual intercourse.^[4] In the U.S., women outnumber
   men in college enrollment by 4 to 3, leading some researchers to argue
   that the gender imbalance fosters a culture of hooking up because men,
   as the minority and limiting factor, hold more power in the sexual
   marketplace and use it to pursue their preference of casual sex over
   long-term relationships.^[46]

   However, most students overestimate the number of hookups in which
   their peers engage.^[47]^[16] Only 20% of students regularly hook
   up.^[45] Roughly one half will occasionally hook up, and one-third of
   students do not hook up at all.^[45] The median number of college
   hookups reported by graduating seniors is seven, and the average
   college student acquires two new sexual partners during their college
   career.^[45] Half of all hookups are repeats, and 25% of students will
   graduate from college a virgin.^[45] African American female students
   are less likely to engage in hookup sex than white female
   students.^[16]

   One study has found that the strongest predictor of hookup behavior was
   previous experience hooking up. Those who have engaged in hookups that
   involve penetrative sex are 600% more likely to hookup again during the
   same semester.^[14]^[48]

   Subculture can affect gender roles and sexuality, and youth subcultures
   are particularly susceptible to peer pressure.^[citation needed]
   Self-esteem is also an indicator: men with high self-esteem and women
   with low self-esteem are more likely to have multiple sexual partners,
   but hookups are less likely among both genders when they have high
   self-esteem. Most predictors among males and females rarely
   differ.^[49]

   One third of gay and bisexual college men have met an anonymous sexual
   partner in a public place such as a park, bookstore, or restroom.^[11]
   Other venues such as public cruising areas, Internet cruising networks,
   and bathhouses are popular for gay men, but not for lesbians or
   heterosexuals.^[11]

   The trend toward marrying later may be what is fueling the hookup scene
   on college campuses.^[50] At colleges, hookups are common between
   students at parties, in dormitories and fraternity houses, at
   surrounding bars and clubs, and at popular student vacation
   destinations. For example, a study of Canadian college students who
   planned to hookup while on spring break showed that 61% of men and 34%
   of women had sex within a day of meeting their partner.^[11]

   Another study was based on a survey of over 18,000 college students
   from ages 18–25. This survey asked questions like how many sexual
   partners they have had since graduating high school, how many sexual
   partners per year, and how many times per week they have sex. It was
   reported that a little over 59% of college students have sex once per
   week. A little over 31% reported to having at least one sexual partner
   per year, and about 50% said that they have had more than two sexual
   partners since the age of 18.^[51] Perceptions of "frat boys" and how
   this stereotype seems to be the typical male who only pursues women to
   have sexual relations. Many female college students explained how the
   "frat boy" perfectly embodies the persona of a sex driven male.^[50]

Relationships

   [edit]

   Hooking up generally refers to having sex; however, many others
   indicated that when they say hooking up they are referring to something
   less than intercourse.^[52] In a hookup culture, young people often
   have little experience with dating and developing romantic
   relationships.^[53]^[54] Hooking up is means for experiencing casual
   sexual encounters, but it is also a means for beginning
   relationships.^[50] Students often feel that hookups are the only
   option and that their peers do not date, which becomes a
   self-fulfilling prophecy as fewer students date because they believe
   their classmates do not believe in dating.^[55] Freitas' study has
   found that students on these campuses generally feel that the decision
   about whether or not to be in a relationship is out of their control
   and that "hookup culture dictated for them that there would be no
   dating and that they simply had to endure this reality."^[21]

   Kimmel believes that while sexual promiscuity once existed on college
   campuses alongside more traditional forms of dating, hooking up is now
   "the alpha and omega of young adult romance."^[56] Wade, on the other
   hand, says that college students are merely engaging in a different
   form of courtship that often results in monogamous relationships.^[45]
   This view is echoed by Armstrong, Hamilton and England, who state that
   college students have not abandoned dating.^[10] Some students claim
   that hookups fit their busy personal and professional schedules better
   than traditional dating does and is thus liberating.^[57] Freitas
   counters that living in the hookup culture is not at all liberating if
   what students want is to actually go on dates.^[58]

   Freitas has opined that a "hookup is a sexual act that thwarts meaning,
   purpose, and relationship."^[59] However, most students do want to be
   in a romantic relationship.^[8]^[11]^[45] One study has found that 63%
   of college-aged men and 83% of college-aged women would prefer a
   traditional romantic relationship at their current stage in life to
   casual sex.^[11] Additionally, 95% of women and 77% of men say they
   prefer dating to hooking up.^[45] "Without exception," sex counselor
   Ian Kerner says, "[students] discuss a long-term monogamous
   relationship as their desired end goal."^[8] While more than half of
   students of both genders say they would like a hookup to develop into a
   romantic relationship,^[8]^[11]^[60] only 6.5% (4.4% of men and 8.2% of
   women) expect that one will.^[14]^[61] 51% of women, and 42% of men,
   have tried discussing the possibility of beginning a romantic
   relationship with a hookup partner.^[11]

   More than half of college relationships begin with a hookup, Bogle's
   research has found.^[62]^[63] Freitas' study shows that when a
   relationship is born of a hookup, it is usually after months of
   engaging in a series of sexual encounters.^[64] Relationships that
   begin as a hookup, or as a "friends with benefits" situation, report
   lower levels of satisfaction.^[11] Garcia says that hookup culture can
   lead to a lower incidence of dating among youth, but as people get a
   bit older they outgrow their desire for hookups and settle into
   traditional dating.^[8]

   Oftentimes, men and women seem to not be on the "same page." According
   to Bogle, many males believed that females often invested themselves or
   had an ulterior motive for pursuing a hookup like situation. For
   instance, when a male student was asked if he felt that women looked
   for different components in a hookup; his response was that most
   females generally did not lean towards a "one and done" thing.^[50]

   Sociologist Wade^[16] discusses several scholars who disagree that
   contemporary college students desire long-term monogamous
   relationships. She cites Elizabeth Armstrong and Laura Hamilton,^[65]
   Hanna Rosin,^[66] and Kate Taylor^[57] who posit that hookup culture is
   good for women as it frees them to focus on their studies and on their
   professional development for careers instead of seeking a long-term
   partner or marriage.

   Freitas believes the lessons imparted by hookup culture have "set back"
   students who often have little experience dating, and few skills in
   asking a romantic partner out as a result.^[1] There has been such a
   decline in dating culture on college campuses that most students have
   had more hookups than first dates.^[8] On some campuses, dating is so
   rare that many students do not have the skills to know how to ask
   someone out.^[1] Boston College even offers a course on how to plan and
   execute a date.^[1]

Peer culture

   [edit]

   College students base their sexual ideas and sexual actions within a
   peer culture, where students who are peers are comparing and differing
   sexual situations in one's own life among one another to create a
   foundation for the current hookup culture.^[17] Kathleen Bogle
   describes the peer culture at universities as the "sexual arena."^[17]
   College students on campuses create and explore their own sexual beings
   in life by referencing others' intimacy, which tends to be presented
   publicly.^[17]

   This peer culture is not reserved to college students, but it may start
   to develop around the time puberty starts in middle school for both
   genders around the age of eleven to fourteen years old. In general,
   puberty is a time that sexuality and self-awareness becomes a main
   focus for individuals to formulate this aspect of their identity. Once
   in college, for most students, the parental aspect is diminished, which
   leaves them feeling a high degree of freedom to truly explore and
   expand their whole personal identity, strongly including sexual
   identity in this "sexual arena."^[17]

   According to Bogle, the campuses her studies were done at had a common
   trend of college students being strongly interested in every other
   student's private life.^[17] That awareness of all the happenings in
   other students' lives made the college scene an open door in looking at
   others' relationships and sexual intimacy.^[17] College is a highly
   public environment, and any kind of sexual activity or public display
   of affection at parties or on campus is exposed to others. The viewers
   of that activity process, interpret, and form assumptions about what
   was observed. Those types of sexual activity or public displays of
   affection could be as meaningless as two individuals romantically
   speaking to each other in a high-capacity location on campus or could
   be as extreme as two individuals walking into a bedroom together at a
   party.^[17]

   The peer culture has evolved and escalated with access to rapid
   communication such as texting on cell phones and multiple social media
   applications. Most of those social media applications are identity
   profiles, public thought disposals, and virtual photo albums of oneself
   in which others' are just a click away from cyberanalysis of how that
   individual displays themselves physically, sexually, psychologically,
   emotionally, and mentally on the internet. Bogle states that the
   knowing of others' personal lives is not just a purpose to gossip, but
   a way to observe, analyze, and be impacted by other's sexual actions,
   solely for the purpose of their own actions.^[17] A peer culture is one
   in which norms surface because individuals begin to conduct themselves
   in the same manner as their peers, which creates the typical and common
   style of acquitting oneself.^[17]

Risks

   [edit]

   Most people choose to take part in hookups to experience physical
   intimacy and sexual pleasure, but that type of behavior can result in a
   variety of negative outcomes, too.^[16] The impacts can range from
   "emotional and psychological injury, sexual violence, sexually
   transmitted infections (STIs), and/or unintended pregnancy."^[16]
   Despite the known potential effects, many college students are either
   unaware or unbothered by those sexual risks.^[67] According to a survey
   focused on how students perceive the risk of contracting sexual
   diseases, only half of a group of 71 students reported having concerns
   about STI contraction while they engaged in sexual intercourse.^[67]
   Further analysis of the survey determined that many students claimed to
   trust their sexual partners and communities too much and that they were
   misinformed about sexual risks in general.^[67] Research suggests
   frequent drug or alcohol use can also lead to lower perceptions of
   those health risks.^[19]^[32]^[16]

   Engaging in hook-ups can have negative effects on a person's mental
   health as well, including feelings of anxiety or discomfort.^[16]^[68]
   One study suggests that nearly 35% of surveyed students described
   feeling regretful or disappointed after a hookup.^[20]^[68] Experts
   have used qualitative analyses to gauge both the type and the level of
   regret that a student might have after uncommitted sex. Many reported
   having feelings of embarrassment, emotional issues, and an overall lack
   of respect from their peers.^[16]^[69]

   Garcia's review has found that hookups can result in emotional and
   psychological injury, sexual violence, sexually transmitted infections,
   and/or unintended pregnancy.^[11]^[14] Most students report with not
   concerning themselves with or being concerned about the health risks
   that come with hookups, however, especially if their partner was a
   member of their own community, such as a student on the same college
   campus.^[11] Garcia notes that there can be much pressure when it comes
   to hooking up, which can contribute to discomfort, performance anxiety,
   and stress.^[69]

   Some studies have found that students, both men and women,
   overwhelmingly regret their hookups.^[11] In one, 77% of students
   regretted their hookups,^[14]^[70] and in another, 78% of women and 72%
   of men who had uncommitted vaginal, anal, and/or oral sex regretted the
   experience.^[14]^[70] Intercourse that occurred less than 24 hours
   after meeting and those that took place only one time are the most
   likely to be regretted.^[71] Men were more likely to be sorry for
   having used another person, and women regretted the experience because
   they felt they had been used.^[14]^[71] While women usually felt worse
   after a hookup than men do, 39% of men expressed extreme regret, shame,
   and frustration with themselves about their hookup experiences.^[72]

   Other studies found that many college students do not regret their
   hookup experiences. Wade interviewed many women and men who were
   enthusiastic about their hookup experiences.^[16] Vrangalova and Ong's
   study documented that students who had a stable personality orientation
   towards casual sex reported a heightened sense of well-being after
   experiencing casual sex.^[73] In Owen and Fincham's study, "Both men
   and women reported that their emotional reactions to hookups were more
   positive than negative".^[74] Fielder and Carey's study of hookups
   among female college students found that "participants enjoyed their
   most recent hookups ... and indicated a low level of regret".^[75]

   Some research shows that hookup regret is gendered, with women tending
   to regret hooking up much more than men do. According to one study of
   832 college students, 26% of women and 50% of men reported positive
   emotional reactions following a hookup, and 49% of women and 26% of men
   reported negative reactions following a hookup.^[11] According to one
   study, there are at least four explanations for why women may regret
   hookups more than men. They may have different attitudes towards
   relationships, hooking up, and sex; there may be differences in sexual
   initiation and agency within hookups; there may be differences in the
   frequency of orgasm within hookups;^[76] and there may be differences
   in perceived inequality in orgasms during hookups.^[77] Other studies,
   such as Vrangalova and Ong, found no gender difference.^[73]

   Regret from hooking up may be linked to negative emotional outcomes,
   especially in women. According to an article by Steven E. Rhoads, Laura
   Webber, et al., "the more partners women have in the course of their
   lives, the more likely they are to be depressed, to cry almost every
   day, and to report relatively low satisfaction with their lives."^[78]
   In Premarital Sex in America: How Young Americans Meet, Mate, and Think
   About Marrying, Mark Regnerus and Jeremy Uecker report that having more
   sexual partners is associated with "poorer emotional states in women,
   but not in men."^[79]

   The American Psychological Association also states that hookups can
   result in guilt and negative feelings. In a study of 169 sexually
   experienced men and women surveyed in singles' bars, when presented
   with the statement, "I feel guilty or would feel guilty about having
   sexual intercourse with someone I had just met," 32 percent of men and
   72 percent of women agreed.^[80]^[14]

   Students who reported to Freitas that they were profoundly upset about
   hooking up stated the encounters made them feel, among other things,
   used, miserable, disgusted, and duped.^[81] To avoid becoming a victim,
   experts believe "that the first step is to acknowledge the dangers
   inherent in the free-and-easy hookup approach to dating and sex."^[82]
   In one qualitative study, only 2% felt desirable or wanted after a
   hookup.^[83] More than a third, on the other hand, felt regretful or
   disappointed, and others reported feeling nervous or uncomfortable as
   well.^[83]

Drugs and alcohol

   [edit]
   [250px-A_glamorous_woman_looking_ruefully_into_her_empty_wine_glass_Wel
   lcome_L0027289.jpg] A poster that represents a warning against the
   risks posed by alcohol consumption, promiscuity, and venereal diseases.

   Some studies have made a connection between hookup culture and
   substance use.^[14] Most students said that their hookups occurred
   after drinking alcohol.^[14]^[84]^[85] Frietas stated that in her
   study, the relationships between drinking and the party scene and
   between alcohol and hookup culture were "impossible to miss."^[86]
   Hookups "almost always" occur when at least one participant is drunk,
   according to Kimmel.^[87] On average, men have five drinks when they
   hook up and women three.^[87] Students who reported using marijuana or
   cocaine in the past year were also more likely than their peers to have
   hooked up during that period.^[14]^[88]

   About a third of the students who reported engaging in vaginal, anal,
   or oral sex during a hookup reported being very intoxicated, and
   another third reported being mildly intoxicated.^[14]^[89] Alcohol may
   act as a cue regarding sexual availability, as a disinhibitor, and as a
   rationalization or an excuse for their behavior, poor sexual
   performance, premature ejaculation, and other sexual
   dysfunctions.^[90]^[14]^[83] It also is the "liquid courage," which
   allows them to make a sexual advance in the first place.^[90]

   Studies suggest that the degree of alcoholic intoxication directly
   correlates with the level of risky behavior.^[49] In one study, 33% of
   those who had hooked up indicated that it was "unintentional" and
   likely from the influence of alcohol or other drugs.^[14]^[61] In a
   survey of first-year students, women said that 64% of their hookups
   came after drinking alcohol.^[14]^[84] Those results were similar to
   another study, which found that 61% of all undergraduates reported
   drinking alcohol before their last hookup.^[14]^[85]

   Studies have generally shown that greater alcohol use is associated
   with more sexual activity over the course of a hookup.^[14]^[48] The
   students who reported consuming the least amount of alcohol were also
   the least likely to hookup. At the other end of the spectrum, the
   greatest alcohol consumption was associated with penetrative sex and
   less alcohol consumption with non-penetrative hookups.^[14]^[48] Of
   those who took part in a hookup that included vaginal, anal, or oral
   sex, 35% were very intoxicated, 27% were mildly intoxicated, 27% were
   sober, and 9% were extremely intoxicated.^[14]^[89]

"Dry dating" trend

   [edit]

   A recent trend called "dry dating" is gaining popularity to replace
   "liquid courage", which involves going on dates without consuming
   alcohol.^[91]^[92]^[93]

Wider culture

   [edit]
   [250px-Hookup_apps.jpg] Mobile applications have become very popular in
   regards to online dating, but have also served as a way for people to
   engage in hook-ups.

   Hookup culture on college campuses is intertwined with a broader
   society. On the other hand, some sociologists have argued that hookup
   culture is a characteristic of the American college environment and
   does not reflect broader American youth culture, just as many college
   graduates stop engaging in hookups when they leave college by
   preferring dating or other sexual arrangements.^[3] Others, including
   Michael Kimmel, have said that "the hookup culture can extend for
   years" beyond college, "well into their thirties and even their
   forties."^[94] Baby boomer fears of hookup culture have been termed a
   "moral panic."^[10] Until recently, those who studied the rise of
   hookup culture generally assumed that it was driven by men and that
   women were reluctant participants, who were more interested in romance
   than casual sexual encounters. However, evidence exists that young
   women are propelling it too.^[46]

   Hookup culture also exists outside of the college environment.
   Location-based geosocial networking smartphone applications, also known
   as hookup apps or dating apps, are increasingly being used to locate
   potential hookups.^[13] Men who have sex with men (MSM) commonly use
   mobile dating apps designed for the gay male market such as Grindr,
   Jack'd, and SCRUFF to find hookup partners.^[95] One study noted that
   gay men's increased use of mobile hookup apps has eroded gay public
   life, especially for those gay men who are on the urban margins in
   terms of social class and generation.^[96] Hookup apps designed for
   heterosexuals emerged after the gay-oriented Grindr; Tinder, for
   example, was introduced in 2013.^[97] There have been a variety of
   dating apps for women who identify as lesbian, but they have been
   criticized for merely being "reskins" of successful hookup apps for gay
   men.^[97] Daatch is described as one of the few successful hookup apps
   designed for lesbians.^[97]

   Life course studies indicate that as people grow older and subjectively
   identify as adult, they are less likely to engage in casual sexual
   behavior.^[98] However, social scientists recognize that there is
   little scientific research on older people's sex lives and so no
   definitive conclusions may be drawn.^[99]

Media

   [edit]
   See also: Media and American adolescent sexuality

   The American Academy of Pediatrics argues that media representations of
   sexuality may influence teen sexual behavior,^[100] a view that is
   supported by a number of studies.^[11]^[101]^[102]^[unbalanced
   opinion?] Some studies suggest that teens who watch movies with more
   sexual content tend to become sexually active at an earlier age and to
   engage in riskier sexual behaviors.^[103] The idea is that the media
   may serve as a "super peer" for youth,^[104] who then seek to develop a
   sexual identity that is in line with popular portrayals.^[4]^[105] On
   the other side, conservatives opposed to hookup culture have sparked
   controversy and come under criticism.^[106]

   Cable television is filled with reality shows that depict an image of
   partying and glorified hookups, one of the most well known shows being
   MTV's Jersey Shore.^[29] Studies have found that about 35% of sexual
   behavior on cable television is with people "who are not in established
   committed relationships."^[29] In television, sexual monogamy differs
   by gender, which suggests men stray away from commitment, and women
   desire it.^[107] That further suggesting that masculinity is equal to
   sex and possibly leads male viewers to be more accepting of hookup
   culture.^[107]

   As the cost of personal computers dropped and online access has
   increased, Heldman and Wade, along with others, argue that internet
   pornography has "emerged as a primary influence on young people's,
   especially men's, attitudes towards sex and their own
   sexuality."^[4]^[104]^[108] Heldman and Wade believe that the increase
   of access to pornography via the internet is what "spurred" hookup
   culture, in part by challenging the idea that "good sex" takes place in
   a monogamous relationship.^[108]^[1] Feminist Gail Dines has opined
   that pornography is "a cultural force that is shaping the sexual
   attitudes of an entire generation" and a "major form of sex ed today
   for boys."^[109]

Extra effects and causes

   [edit]

   There are many ideas as to why people think young adults are involved
   in hookup culture, such as that they feel like they have to do it to
   fit in.^[8] Some girls also reported that the main reason that they are
   involved with random hookups is because they think that is what boys
   want.^[110] The feeling of being wanted by a cute guy is what they want
   and hookups are how girls think that they can get that attention.
   However, many boys and girls reported that they do hookup with random
   people to find someone with whom they could possibly start something
   serious.^[8] That being said, not all young adults are hooking up with
   each other to fit the college norm and gain sexual pleasure, but some
   truly want to find someone with whom they have a serious connection.
   There was a study by University of Louisville researchers Owen and
   Fincham, who asked 500 undergraduate students that have been involved
   in hookup culture how they felt about commitment. About 45% of men and
   65% of women said they wanted their hookups to possibly end up in a
   serious relationship.^[111]

   There have also been a number of studies that have studied the mental
   aspects of casual hookups. A study done by psychologist Seth Schwartz
   has shown results that people who had many random hookups had more
   psychological issues.^[112] For instance, students in college that had
   stated they were involved in casual sex had higher levels of depression
   and anxiety and lower levels of self-esteem, happiness and life
   satisfaction compared to the students who did not engage in a casual
   hookup in the past thirty days.^[112] There was then a study of about
   400 young adults that felt lonely and depressed and adults who had less
   feeling of loneliness and depression who were involved in sexual
   intercourse.^[14] They then researched what emotional affects being
   involved in sexual intercourse hookups had on them. They came up with
   results that showed that penetrative sex hookups made people with
   greater feelings of depression and loneliness have a decrease in those
   symptoms and feelings.^[14] People who expressed fewer symptoms of
   loneliness and depression had an increase in those feelings after a
   penetrative sex hookup.^[14] It makes people feel depressed but also
   uncomfortable. For example, a study by Reiber and Garcia in 2010 show
   that many people who engage in sexual hookups feel uncomfortable.^[14]
   They also concluded that 78% of people in a hookup overestimate how
   comfortable their partner is doing certain things during their sexual
   engagement. Random hookups also have shown to cause feelings of
   pressure and performance anxiety in a study by Paul, et al.^[14]

   The continuation of the sexual double standard between men and women
   may be due to the motivations behind men's and women's hook ups. The
   sexual marketplace makes it seem that women hold all of the power, but
   most women report engaging in casual sex to satisfy their partners and
   increase the possibility of it turning into a long-term, monogamous
   relationship in which men use casual sex to increase their sexual
   experience and explore themselves before they are tied down by
   marriage.^[30]

Communication theory

   [edit]

   The majority of academic research about hookup culture focuses on the
   psychological, biological, and societal influences on an individual's
   inclination to engage in uncommitted sex, but some scholars have
   examined theories of communication and how they relate to hook-up
   culture.

Attachment theory

   [edit]

   The premise behind John Bowlby's attachment theory is to "describe the
   behaviors that humans use to relate to one another."^[73]^[113]
   Attachment theory suggests people develop an attachment style during
   childhood and then carry it into adulthood, where it can have impacts
   on the relationships they form.^[73]^[113] Researcher Mary Ainsworth
   identified different attachment styles and suggested that they can
   influence someone's relational and sexual behavior.^[73]^[114] In one
   analysis, these attachment styles were applied to explain how
   homosexual men behave sexually.^[73] For example, gay men with an
   anxious-ambivalent attachment style (an individual made uncomfortable
   by "close emotional relationships, but will desperately try to seek out
   reassurance from another person") might be more reluctant to use
   condoms during sexual intercourse because they believe that will make
   them feel more wanted by their partner.^[73]^[115] Meanwhile, a gay man
   with an anxious-avoidant attachment style (an individual who does not
   like to get close to others) will most likely try to remain
   disconnected from his partner for fear of becoming too close or
   intimate.^[73]^[115]

Sexual script theory

   [edit]

   How cultural norms affects someone's sexual habits and behavior is
   defined as sexual script theory.^[19]^[25] Researchers John Gagnon and
   William Simon originally developed the concept and suggested these
   scripts serve as "guides for behavior."^[25] The scripts can help
   individuals determine what is and is not appropriate based on
   surrounding cultural influences.^[25] In the United States, the script
   includes "kissing, then sexual touching, and ultimately culminates in
   sexual intercourse (i.e., the 'bases')."^[19] The sexual scripts also
   help define gender roles and explain the actions that both males and
   females take in hookups and uncommitted sexual encounters.^[19]^[25]

   Casual sexual scripts have emerged as a subset of traditional sexual
   scripts.^[116] The traditional dating script follows a formal pattern
   and heteronormative gender roles.^[116] The casual script is perceived
   as less formal and lacks clarity.^[116]

   Hookups seem to offer a chance to break away from normative dating
   patterns. Research on friends with benefits relationships contradicts
   this perception.^[117] Some women seek to flip the gender scripts and
   behave as a powerful man might with casual relationships.^[117] They
   suppress their emotions and in turn feel a lack of power and
   control.^[117] Reverting to characteristics of traditional sexual
   scripts, women may find themselves further entrenched in unwanted
   gender roles.^[117]

   Mediated sexual scripts portray two different narratives for men and
   women.^[118] The male script portrays sex as uncomplicated, fun, and
   expected.^[118] The female sexual script emphasizes the need for
   caution and expectation of criticism.^[118] When viewed, the mediated
   scripts encode into personal sexual script and influence
   behavior.^[118] The results of a study looking at first-year college
   students supported that claim. Male students were likely to endorse or
   take part in hookup culture if they had viewed such scripts.^[118]

Cultivation theory

   [edit]

   The concept of cultivation theory suggests "media influence people
   indirectly."^[25] Researchers suggest that how media portray sexual
   activity of different age groups is disproportionate to
   reality.^[25]^[119] Someone who consumes a variety of media will
   demonstrate such influences when they are confronted with hookups or
   uncommitted sexual scenarios.^[25]^[119]

Research

   [edit]

   Most research regarding hookup culture has been reliant on conducting
   interviews and surveys with sexually active individuals, particularly
   those at a high school or college level.^[19]^[32]^[25] Each
   investigator's set of questions, however, has served a different
   purpose in the overall analysis of hookup culture.

Research to explain a "hookup"

   [edit]

   Scholars have expressed the difficulty of defining a "hookup" since it
   has different meanings, based on cultural norms and personal
   preferences.^[19]^[32]^[25]^[16] Researchers like Kathleen Bogle and
   Donna Freitas have interviewed males and females, both separately and
   together, to gain a better understanding of the hookup culture on
   campuses in the United States.^[19]^[32] Their studies have focused on
   how the growing hookup culture has shaped the trajectory of dating and
   forming relationships, and they have also aimed to gain a better
   understanding of the difference in sexual scripts between men and
   women.^[19]^[32] They have also used this data to help further explain
   what specific actions and behaviors constitute a hookup.^[19]^[32]

Influences of dating sites and apps

   [edit]

   Another avenue of research has studied the influences of dating
   websites and mobile dating apps on hookup culture.^[15]^[16]^[73]
   Scholar Carey Noland suggests the advent of finding hookups or dates
   through the Internet has made talking about sex easier because of the
   possibility to "skip the small talk" and not needing to worry about the
   normal "barriers" of saving face by talking to someone
   online.^[25]^[120] Additional research has analyzed hookup patterns to
   see how mobile app developers have catered to their potential
   users.^[15] For example, the creators of Grindr capitalized on the
   increased sexual desires among gay men^[73]^[36] to base its app on
   locational awareness.^[15] That paved the way for apps in which users
   can find connections and meet up with people, who are often right
   around the corner.^[15]

Understanding the risks

   [edit]

   Research conducted on hook-up culture has also been applied to
   scientific studies about sexually transmitted infections. Knowing more
   information about a man's or a woman's behavior during casual sex has
   increased the understanding of how STIs are contracted, whether it is
   through oral sex or sexual intercourse and how frequently or
   infrequently individuals take steps to prevent them.^[16]^[67] By
   interviewing individuals who engage in hookups, scholars have been able
   to better address health risk perceptions or the lack thereof.
   Researchers have also applied their findings to study the potential
   psychological effects of hookups, including feelings of depression or
   regret.^[16]^[68]^[69]

Effect on future relationships

   [edit]

   According to a 2004 peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of
   Marriage and Family found that women who have more than one premarital
   sexual relationship have a higher likelihood in the long run of
   disruptions if ever married, with this effect being the "strongest for
   women who have multiple premarital coresidential unions".^[121] Kahn
   and London (1991) found that premarital sex and divorce are positively
   correlated.^[122] According to a 2014 report, couples that began as
   hook-ups tended to have lower marital quality than couples who had not
   begun as a hook up.^[123]

Areas for future research

   [edit]

   Experts have suggested several areas for future research, including
   additional studies about how members of the LGBTQ community are
   impacted and have been affected by hookup culture.^[73]^[97]^[36]
   Researcher Kathleen Bogle highlights another area of study; she says a
   new focus should be on individuals who choose not to participate in
   hookups and how they are "affected by the dominant hookup culture that
   surrounds them."^[19] Finally, a third avenue for future research could
   include an analytical view of individuals who use apps like Grindr or
   Tinder with hopes of finding connections or developing relationships,
   rather than using them for the more common use of casual hookups.^[15]

Critique

   [edit]

   Several scholars have critiqued how outside influences have shaped or
   contributed to hookup culture as a whole.^[19]^[32]^[25]

   Many ideas and beliefs about the growing hookup culture suggest that
   the act of engaging in uncommitted sex is found primarily among
   teenagers or college students.^[19]^[25] Teenagers and college students
   may be sexually active, but it is important to understand that other
   age and social groups take part in casual sex too.^[19]^[25] One of the
   reasons for that disconnect is the misrepresentation of sexual activity
   among certain age groups in media.^[25]^[119] In television, teens are
   most commonly shown to be sexually active, and it is rare to see any
   kind of sexual activity portrayed for individuals aged 65 or
   older.^[25]^[119] Further research shows, however, that that is
   opposite of the actual sexual activity reported among those age
   groups.^[25]^[119]

   The stereotypes and different sexual scripts of males and females in
   hookups have also been influenced greatly by different media like
   movies, television, and pornography.^[32] In the media, women are
   frequently depicted as "sexual objects" and men portrayed as "there to
   objectify them."^[32]

   On another note, scholars suggest the reality of emotional risks
   associated with hooking up can be linked to a lack of conversation or
   discussion about them.^[25] When discussing sex with adolescents, both
   parents and sex education programs tend to focus on the health risks,
   like STIs and pregnancy, but the exchanges rarely highlight the
   "emotions that occur from sexual experiences."^[25] The conversations
   seldom present information about motives for engaging in sex aside from
   reproduction and rarely acknowledge the positive emotions associated
   with that type of activity like physical pleasure.^[25] The imbalance
   of information regarding sexual behavior and activity has also
   contributed to the sexual scripts that are seen in hookup culture
   today.^[25]

       casual sex and even dating on many college campuses over the years,
       but as is so often the case when sex is discussed, it's not
       altogether clear what everybody is talking about when they say
       "hookup." One new study at a large university suggests that most
       young people are doing it, although not everyone agrees what "it"
       is. Researchers at the University of Montana found so many
       different definitions among the students they studied that they had
       to come up with a precise definition to be sure everybody was
       talking about the same thing."

       relatively small percentage of their parents, who, even if they
       heard it, thought it was being used in the old sense of "meeting"
       someone. Among the children, hooking up was always a sexual
       experience, but the nature and extent of what they did could vary

       cohabitation and premarital sex, as well as histories of
       pre-marital relationships, extends previous research. The most
       salient finding from this analysis is that women whose intimate
       premarital relationships are limited to their husbands—either
       premarital sex alone or premarital cohabitation—do not experience
       an increased risk of divorce. It is only women who have more than

       marital disruption. This effect is strongest for women who have
       multiple premarital coresidental unions."

       premarital cohabitation, that the relationship may be due to either
       selectivity on preexisting characteristics or altered perceptions
       of marriage and alternatives to marriage that occur as the result
       of engaging in premarital sex."
