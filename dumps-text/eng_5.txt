   Conflict between cultural values
   For the "culture war" between the Catholic Church and the German state
   in the 1870s, see Kulturkampf.
   "Culture Wars" redirects here. For the book, see Culture Wars: The
   Struggle to Define America.

   A culture war is a form of cultural conflict (metaphorical war) between
   different social groups who struggle to politically impose their own
   ideology upon mainstream society,^[1]^[2] or upon the other. In
   political usage, culture war is a metaphor for "hot-button" politics
   about values and ideologies, realized with intentionally adversarial
   social narratives meant to provoke political polarization among the
   mainstream of society over economic matters,^[3]^[4] such as those of
   public policy,^[5] as well as of consumption.^[1] As practical
   politics, a culture war is about social policy wedge issues that are
   based on abstract arguments about values, morality, and lifestyle meant
   to provoke political cleavage in a multicultural society.^[2]

Etymology

   [edit]

Kulturkampf

   [edit]
   This section is an excerpt from Kulturkampf.[edit]

   The Kulturkampf (
   German pronunciation: [kʊlˈtuːɐ̯ˌkamp͡f]; lit. 'Cultural Struggle') was
   the seven-year political conflict (1871–1878) between the Catholic
   Church in Germany led by Pope Pius IX and the Kingdom of Prussia, led
   by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, as well as other German states. The
   Prussian church-and-state political conflict was about the church's
   direct control over both education and ecclesiastical appointments in
   the Prussian kingdom. Moreover, when compared to other church-and-state
   conflicts about political culture, the Kulturkampf of Prussia also
   featured anti-Polish sentiment.

   In modern political usage, the German term Kulturkampf describes any
   conflict (political, ideological, or social) between the secular
   government and the religious authorities of a society. The term also
   describes the great and small culture wars among political factions who
   hold deeply opposing values and beliefs within a nation, a community,
   and a cultural group.^[6]^[better source needed]

   In the English language, the term culture war is a calque of the German
   word Kulturkampf (culture struggle), which refers to a historical event
   in Germany. The term appears as the title of an 1875 British book
   review of a German pamphlet.^[7]

Research

   [edit]

Criticism and evaluation

   [edit]

   Since the time that James Davison Hunter first applied the concept of
   culture wars to American life, the idea has been subject to questions
   about whether "culture wars" names a real phenomenon, and if so,
   whether the phenomenon it describes is a cause of, or merely a result
   of, membership in groups like political parties and religions. Culture
   wars have also been subject to the criticism of being artificial,
   imposed, or asymmetric conflicts, rather than a result of authentic
   differences between cultures. Researchers have differed about the
   scientific validity of the notion of culture war. Some claim it does
   not describe real behavior, or that it describes only the behavior of a
   small political elite. Others claim culture war is real and widespread,
   and even that it is fundamental to explaining Americans' political
   behavior and beliefs. A 2023 study on the circulation of conspiracy
   theories on social media noted that disinformation actors insert
   polarizing claims in culture wars by taking one side or the other, thus
   making the adherents circulate and parrot disinformation as a
   rhetorical ammunition against their perceived opponents.^[1]

   Political scientist Alan Wolfe participated in a series of scholarly
   debates in the 1990s and 2000s against Hunter, claiming that Hunter's
   concept of culture wars did not accurately describe the opinions or
   behavior of Americans, which Wolfe claimed were more united than
   polarized.^[8] A meta-analysis of opinion data from 1992 to 2012
   published in the American Political Science Review concluded that, in
   contrast to a common belief that political party and religious
   membership shape opinion on culture war topics, instead opinions on
   culture war topics lead people to revise their political party and
   religious orientations. The researchers view culture war attitudes as
   "foundational elements in the political and religious belief systems of
   ordinary citizens."^[9]

Artificiality or asymmetry

   [edit]

   Some writers and scholars have said that culture wars are created or
   perpetuated by political special interest groups, by reactionary social
   movements, by party dynamics, or by electoral politics as a whole.
   These authors view culture war not as an unavoidable result of
   widespread cultural differences, but as a technique used to create
   in-groups and out-groups for a political purpose. Political commentator
   E. J. Dionne has written that culture war is an electoral technique to
   exploit differences and grievances, remarking that the real cultural
   division is "between those who want to have a culture war and those who
   don't."^[10]

   Sociologist Scott Melzer says that culture wars are created by
   conservative, reactive organizations and movements. Members of these
   movements possess a "sense of victimization at the hands of a liberal
   culture run amok. In their eyes, immigrants, gays, women, the poor, and
   other groups are (undeservedly) granted special rights and privileges."
   Melzer writes about the example of the National Rifle Association of
   America, which he says intentionally created a culture war in order to
   unite conservative groups, particularly groups of white men, against a
   common perceived threat.^[11] Similarly, religion scholar Susan B.
   Ridgely has written that culture wars were made possible by Focus on
   the Family. This organization produced conservative Christian
   "alternative news" that began to bifurcate American media consumption,
   promoting a particular "traditional family" archetype to one part of
   the population, particularly conservative religious women. Ridgely says
   that this tradition was depicted as under liberal attack, seeming to
   necessitate a culture war to defend the tradition.^[12]

   Political scientists Matt Grossmann and David A. Hopkins have written
   about an asymmetry between the US's two major political parties, saying
   the Republican party should be understood as an ideological movement
   built to wage political conflict, and the Democratic party as a
   coalition of social groups with less ability to impose ideological
   discipline on members.^[13] This encourages Republicans to perpetuate
   and to draw new issues into culture wars, because Republicans are well
   equipped to fight such wars.^[14] According to The Guardian, "many on
   the left have argued that such [culture war] battles [a]re
   'distractions' from the real fight over class and economic
   issues."^[15]

United States

   [edit]
   This section is an excerpt from History of ethnocultural politics in
   the United States.[edit]

   In the United States, ethnocultural politics or ethnoreligious politics
   refers to the pattern of certain cultural groups or religious
   denominations to vote heavily for one party. Groups can be based on
   ethnicity (such as Hispanics, Irish, Germans, etc.), race (White
   people, Black people, Asian Americans, etc.) or religion (Protestant
   and later Evangelical or Catholic, etc.) or on overlapping categories
   (e.g. Irish Catholics). In the Southern United States, race was the
   determining factor. Each of the two major parties was a coalition of
   ethnoreligious groups in the Second Party System (1830s–1850s) and also
   in the Third Party System (1850s–1890s).

1920s–1991: Origins

   [edit]
   [icon]
   This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (December
   2021)

   In American usage, culture war may imply a conflict between those
   values considered traditionalist or conservative and those considered
   progressive or liberal. This usage originated in the 1920s when urban
   and rural American values came into closer conflict.^[16] This followed
   several decades of immigration to the States by people who earlier
   European immigrants considered 'alien'. It was also a result of the
   cultural shifts and modernizing trends of the Roaring Twenties,
   culminating in the presidential campaign of Al Smith in 1928.^[17] In
   subsequent decades during the 20th century, the term was published
   occasionally in American newspapers.^[18]^[19] Historian Matthew Dallek
   argues the John Birch Society (JBS) was an early promoter of culture
   war ideas.^[20] Scholar Celestini Carmen traces the JBS's apocalyptic
   culture war rhetoric through the connections of Christian right leaders
   such as Tim LaHaye and Phyllis Schlafly to the JBS and their founding
   of the Moral Majority.^[21]

1991–2001: Rise in prominence

   [edit]

   James Davison Hunter, a sociologist at the University of Virginia,
   introduced the expression again in his 1991 publication, Culture Wars:
   The Struggle to Define America. Hunter described what he saw as a
   dramatic realignment and polarization that had transformed American
   politics and culture. He argued that on an increasing number of
   "hot-button" defining issues—abortion, gun politics, separation of
   church and state, privacy, recreational drug use, homosexuality,
   censorship—there existed two definable polarities. Furthermore, not
   only were there a number of divisive issues, but society had divided
   along essentially the same lines on these issues, so as to constitute
   two warring groups, defined primarily not by nominal religion,
   ethnicity, social class, or even political affiliation, but rather by
   ideological world-views. Hunter characterized this polarity as stemming
   from opposite impulses, toward what he referred to as Progressivism and
   as Orthodoxy. Others have adopted the dichotomy with varying labels.
   For example, Bill O'Reilly, a conservative political commentator and
   former host of the Fox News Channel talk show The O'Reilly Factor,
   emphasizes differences between "Secular-Progressives" and
   "Traditionalists" in his 2006 book Culture Warrior.^[22]^[23]

   Historian Kristin Kobes Du Mez attributes the 1990s emergence of
   culture wars to the end of the Cold War in 1991. She writes that
   Evangelical Christians viewed a particular Christian masculine gender
   role as the only defense of the United States against the threat of
   communism. When this threat ended upon the close of the Cold War,
   Evangelical leaders transferred the perceived source of threat from
   foreign communism to domestic changes in gender roles and
   sexuality.^[24]
   [250px-Patrickjbuchanan.JPG] Pat Buchanan in 2008

   During the 1992 presidential election, commentator Pat Buchanan mounted
   a campaign for the Republican nomination for president against
   incumbent George H. W. Bush. In a prime-time slot at the 1992
   Republican National Convention, Buchanan gave his speech on the culture
   war.^[25] He argued: "There is a religious war going on in our country
   for the soul of America. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind
   of nation we will one day be as was the Cold War itself."^[26] In
   addition to criticizing environmentalists and feminism, he portrayed
   public morality as a defining issue:

     The agenda [Bill] Clinton and [Hillary] Clinton would impose on
     America—abortion on demand, a litmus test for the Supreme Court,
     homosexual rights, discrimination against religious schools, women
     in combat units—that's change, all right. But it is not the kind of
     change America wants. It is not the kind of change America needs.
     And it is not the kind of change we can abide in a nation that we
     still call God's country.^[26]

   A month later, Buchanan characterized the conflict as about power over
   society's definition of right and wrong. He named abortion, sexual
   orientation and popular culture as major fronts—and mentioned other
   controversies, including clashes over the Confederate flag, Christmas,
   and taxpayer-funded art. He also said that the negative attention his
   "culture war" speech received was itself evidence of the United States'
   polarization.^[27]

   The culture war had significant impact on national politics in the
   1990s.^[4] The rhetoric of the Christian Coalition of America may have
   weakened president George H. W. Bush's chances for re-election in 1992
   and helped his successor, Bill Clinton, win reelection in 1996.^[28] On
   the other hand, the rhetoric of conservative cultural warriors helped
   Republicans gain control of Congress in 1994.^[29] The culture wars
   influenced the debate over state-school history curricula in the United
   States in the 1990s. In particular, debates over the development of
   national educational standards in 1994 revolved around whether the
   study of American history should be a "celebratory" or "critical"
   undertaking and involved such prominent public figures as Lynne Cheney,
   Rush Limbaugh, and historian Gary Nash.^[30]^[31]

2001–2012: Post-9/11 era

   [edit]
   [250px-Bush_War_Budget_2003-crop.jpg] (from right to left) 43rd
   President George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, and Paul Wolfowitz were
   prominent neoconservatives of the 2000s.

   A political view called neoconservatism shifted the terms of the debate
   in the early 2000s. Neoconservatives differed from their opponents in
   that they interpreted problems facing the nation as moral issues rather
   than economic or political ones. For example, neoconservatives saw the
   decline of the traditional family structure as well as the decline of
   religion in American society as spiritual crises that required a
   spiritual response. Critics accused neoconservatives of confusing cause
   and effect.^[32]

   During the 2000s, voting for Republicans began to correlate heavily
   with traditionalist or orthodox religious belief across diverse
   religious sects. Voting for Democrats became more correlated with
   liberal or modernist religious belief, and with being
   nonreligious.^[10] Belief in scientific conclusions, such as climate
   change, also became tightly coupled with political party affiliation in
   this era, causing climate scholar Andrew Hoffman to observe that
   climate change had "become enmeshed in the so-called culture
   wars."^[33]

   Topics traditionally associated with culture war were not prominent in
   media coverage of the 2008 election season, with the exception of
   coverage of vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin,^[34] who drew
   attention to her conservative religion and created a performative
   climate change denialism brand for herself.^[35] Palin's defeat in the
   election and subsequent resignation as governor of Alaska caused the
   Center for American Progress to predict "the coming end of the culture
   wars," which they attributed to demographic change, particularly high
   rates of acceptance of same-sex marriage among millennials.^[36]

   In the early 2010s, the American right took issue with the perceived
   worldwide dominance of leftism in international politics and corporate
   activity, anti-nationalism, and secular human rights policies and
   activism not based on Abrahamic religious worldviews.^[37]

   While traditional culture war issues, like abortion, continue to be a
   focal point,^[38] the issues identified with the culture war broadened
   and intensified in the mid-late 2010s. Jonathan Haidt, author of The
   Coddling of the American Mind, identified a rise in cancel culture via
   social media among young progressives since 2012, which he believes had
   "transformative effects on university life and later on politics and
   culture throughout the English-speaking world," in what Haidt^[39] and
   other commentators^[40]^[41] have called the "Great Awokening".
   Journalist Michael Grunwald says that "President Donald Trump has
   pioneered a new politics of perpetual culture war" and lists Black
   Lives Matter, U.S. national anthem protests, climate change, education
   policy, healthcare policy including Obamacare, and infrastructure
   policy as culture war issues in 2018.^[42] The rights of transgender
   people and the role of religion in lawmaking were identified as "new
   fronts in the culture war" by political scientist Jeremiah Castle, as
   the polarization of public opinion on these two topics resembles that
   of previous culture war issues.^[43] In 2020, during the COVID-19
   pandemic, North Dakota governor Doug Burgum described opposition to
   wearing face masks as a "senseless" culture war issue that jeopardizes
   human safety.^[44]

   Lufkin, Texas in relation to the LGBT grooming conspiracy theory.

   This broader understanding of culture war issues in the mid-late 2010s
   and 2020s is associated with a political strategy called "owning the
   libs." Conservative media figures employing this strategy emphasize and
   expand upon culture war issues with the goal of upsetting liberals.
   According to Nicole Hemmer of Columbia University, this strategy is a
   substitute for the cohesive conservative ideology that existed during
   the Cold War. It holds a conservative voting bloc together in the
   absence of shared policy preferences among the bloc's members.^[45]

   wars^[46]

   A number of conflicts about diversity in popular culture occurring in
   the 2010s, such as the Gamergate controversy, Comicsgate and the Sad
   Puppies science fiction voting campaign, were identified in the media
   as being examples of the culture war.^[47] Journalist Caitlin Dewey
   described Gamergate as a "proxy war" for a larger culture war between
   those who want greater inclusion of women and minorities in cultural
   institutions versus anti-feminists and traditionalists who do not.^[48]
   The perception that culture war conflict had been demoted from
   electoral politics to popular culture led writer Jack Meserve to call
   popular movies, games, and writing the "last front in the culture war"
   in 2015.^[49]

   These conflicts about representation in popular culture re-emerged into
   electoral politics via the alt-right and alt-lite movements.^[50]
   According to media scholar Whitney Phillips, Gamergate "prototyped"
   strategies of harassment and controversy-stoking that proved useful in
   political strategy. For example, Republican political strategist Steve
   Bannon publicized pop-culture conflicts during the 2016 presidential
   campaign of Donald Trump, encouraging a young audience to "come in
   through Gamergate or whatever and then get turned onto politics and
   Trump."^[51]

Canada

   [edit]

   Main articles: Political culture of Canada and Monuments and memorials

   Some observers in Canada have used the term "culture war" to refer to
   differing values between Western versus Eastern Canada, urban versus
   rural Canada, as well as conservatism versus liberalism and
   progressivism.^[52] The phrase has also been used to describe the
   Harper government's attitude towards the arts community. Andrew Coyne
   termed this negative policy towards the arts community as "class
   warfare."^[53]

Australia

   [edit]

   See also: Australian history wars

   During the tenure of the Liberal–National Coalition government of 1996
   to 2007, interpretations of Aboriginal history became a part of a wider
   political debate regarding Australian national pride and symbolism
   occasionally called the "culture wars", more often the "history
   wars".^[54] This debate extended into a controversy over the
   presentation of history in the National Museum of Australia and in
   high-school history curricula.^[55]^[56] It also migrated into the
   general Australian media, with major broadsheets such as The
   Australian, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age regularly publishing
   opinion pieces on the topic. Marcia Langton has referred to much of
   this wider debate as "war porn"^[57] and as an "intellectual dead
   end".^[58]

   Two Australian Prime Ministers, Paul Keating (in office 1991–1996) and
   John Howard (in office 1996–2007), became major participants in the
   "wars". According to Mark McKenna's analysis for the Australian
   Parliamentary Library,^[59] Howard believed that Keating portrayed
   Australia pre-Whitlam (PM 1972–1975) in an unduly negative light, while
   Keating sought to distance the modern Labor movement from its
   historical support for the monarchy and for the White Australia policy
   by arguing that it was the conservative Australian parties which had
   been barriers to national progress. He accused Britain of having
   abandoned Australia during the Second World War. Keating staunchly
   supported a symbolic apology to Aboriginal Australians for their
   mistreatment at the hands of previous administrations, and outlined his
   view of the origins and potential solutions to contemporary Aboriginal
   disadvantage in his Redfern Park Speech of December 10, 1992 (drafted
   with the assistance of historian Don Watson). In 1999, following the
   release of the 1998 Bringing Them Home Report, Howard passed a
   parliamentary Motion of Reconciliation describing treatment of
   Aboriginal people as the "most blemished chapter" in Australian
   history, but declined to issue an official apology.^[60] Howard saw an
   apology as inappropriate as it would imply "intergeneration guilt",
   saying measures were a better response to contemporary Aboriginal
   disadvantage. Keating argued for the eradication of remaining symbols
   linked to colonial origins, including deference for ANZAC Day,^[61] for
   the Australian flag, and for the monarchy in Australia, while Howard
   supported these institutions. Unlike fellow Labor leaders and
   contemporaries, Bob Hawke (PM 1983–1991) and Kim Beazley (Labor Party
   leader 2005–2006), Keating never travelled to Gallipoli for ANZAC Day
   ceremonies. In 2008 he described those who gathered there as
   "misguided".^[62]

   The defeat of the Howard government in the 2007 Australian federal
   election and its replacement by the Rudd Labor government altered the
   dynamic of the debate. Rudd made an official apology to the Aboriginal
   Stolen Generations^[63] with bi-partisan support.^[64] Like Keating,
   Rudd supported an Australian republic, but in contrast to Keating, Rudd
   declared support for the Australian flag and supported the
   commemoration of ANZAC Day; he also expressed admiration for Liberal
   Party founder Robert Menzies.^[65]^[66] Subsequent to the 2007 change
   of government, and prior to the passage of the official apology,
   historian Richard Nile argued: "the culture and history wars are over
   and with them should also go the adversarial nature of intellectual
   debate",^[67] a view contested by others, including conservative
   commentator Janet Albrechtsen.^[68]

   Climate change in Australia is also considered a highly divisive or
   politically controversial topic, to the point it is sometimes called a
   "culture war".^[69]^[70]

   Since the defeat of the 2023 Australian Indigenous Voice referendum,
   there has been a significant calls reignited from conservative
   politicians and commentators to oppose or scale down Indigenous
   Reconciliation, viewing customs such as Welcome to Country ceremonies
   and placing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags alongside
   the national flag as "divisive".^[71]

African continent

   [edit]

   According to political scientist Constance G. Anthony, American culture
   war perspectives on human sexuality were exported to Africa as a form
   of neocolonialism. In his view, this began during the AIDS epidemic in
   Africa, with the United States government first tying HIV/AIDS
   assistance money to evangelical leadership and the Christian right
   during the Bush administration, then to LGBTQ tolerance during the
   administration of Barack Obama. This stoked a culture war that resulted
   in (among others) the Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Act of 2014.^[72]

   Zambian scholar Kapya Kaoma notes that because "the demographic center
   of Christianity is shifting from the global North to the global South"
   Africa's influence on Christianity worldwide is increasing. American
   conservatives export their culture wars to Africa, Kaoma says,
   particularly when they realize they may be losing the battle back home.
   US Christians have framed their anti-LGBT initiatives in Africa as
   standing in opposition to a "Western gay agenda", a framing which Kaoma
   finds ironic.^[73]

   North American and European conspiracy theories have become widespread
   in West Africa via social media, according to 2021 survey by First
   Draft News. COVID-19 misinformation, New World Order conspiracy
   thinking, QAnon and other conspiracy theories associated with culture
   war topics are spread by American, Pro-Russian, French-language, and
   local disinformation websites and social media accounts, including
   prominent politicians in Nigeria. This has contributed to vaccine
   hesitancy in West Africa, with 60 percent of survey respondents saying
   they were unlikely to try to get vaccinated, and an erosion of trust in
   institutions in the region.^[74]

   A 2021 report from King's College London argued that many people's
   views on cultural issues in Britain had become tied up with the side of
   the Brexit debate with which they identify, while the public
   party-political identities, although not as strong, show similar
   alignments and that around half the country held relatively strong
   views on "culture war" issues such as debates on Britain's colonial
   history or Black Lives Matter; however, the report concluded Britain's
   cultural and political divide was not as stark as the
   Republican–Democratic divide in the US and that a sizeable section of
   the public can be categorised as having either moderate views or as
   being disengaged from social debates. It also found that The Guardian,
   as opposed to the centre-right newspapers, was more likely to talk
   about the culture wars.^[75]

   The Conservative Party have been described as attempting to ignite
   culture wars in regard to "conservative values" under the tenure of
   Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Others argue that it is the left who are
   engaging in "culture wars", particularly against liberal values,
   accepted words, and British institutions.^[76]^[77]^[78]^[79] Observers
   such as Johns Hopkins University professor Yascha Mounk and journalist
   and author Louise Perry have argued that the collapse in support for
   the Labour Party during the 2019 United Kingdom general election came
   as a result of both a media-induced public perception and a deliberate
   strategy of Labour of pursuing messages and policy ideas based on
   cultural issues that resonated with more university educated grassroots
   activists on the left of the party but alienated Labour's traditional
   working class voters.^[80]^[81]

   An April 2022 survey found evidence that Britons are less divided on
   "culture war" issues than has often been portrayed in the media. The
   greatest predictor of opinion was how people voted in the UK's
   referendum on membership of the European Union, Brexit, yet even among
   those who voted Leave, 75% agreed "it is important to be attentive to
   issues of race and social justice". Similarly, even among Remainers and
   those who last voted for the Labour Party, there was moderately strong
   support for several socially conservative positions.^[82]^[83]

   [250px-Konev_Monument_in_Bubene%C4%8D_%286181%29.jpg] Statue of Ivan

   In 2020, French President Emmanuel Macron promised that France would
   not erase elements of its history or remove statues of controversial
   public figures, saying "The Republic won't erase any name from its
   history. It will forget none of its artworks, it won't take down
   statues."^[84]

   Several politicians, such as Poland's Law and Justice party,^[85]
   Hungary's Viktor Orbán, Serbia's Aleksandar Vučić, and Slovenia's Janez
   Janša,^[86] have been accused of fomenting culture wars in their
   respective countries by encouraging dissent, resistance to LGBT rights,
   and restrictions on abortion. One facet of the controversy in Poland is
   the removal of Soviet War Memorials, which is divisive because some
   Poles viewed the memorials positively as commemorations of their
   ancestors who died during World War II, while others felt negatively
   due to the oppression that some Poles experienced under the
   Soviet-backed Polish People's Republic.^[87]^[88] Culture war in
   Hungary is alleged by Kim Scheppele to be a disguise for democratic
   backsliding by Orbán.^[89] Ukraine also experienced a decades-long
   culture war pitting the eastern, predominately Russian-speaking,
   regions against the western Ukrainian-speaking areas of the
   country.^[90] LGBT rights are controversial in Poland, as exemplified
   by President Andrzej Duda's vow in 2020 to oppose both same-sex
   marriage and LGBT adoption.^[91]^[92]

   Different interpretations of bitter events during World War II have
   become especially contentious in Poland since 2015, shortly after the
   start of the Russo-Ukrainian War.^[93] One disputed issue is whether
   Poland bears any responsibility for the Holocaust, or whether Poland
   was entirely a victim of Nazi Germany. This dispute is embodied by the
   "Polish death camp" controversy (involving concentration camps that had
   been built by Nazi Germany during World War II on German-occupied
   Polish soil) and an attempt to address that controversy with a now
   partly repealed law.^[94]

   A second issue, also addressed by the partly repealed law, revolves
   around Poland–Ukraine relations. In the region, in passing a law to
   criminalize negative interpretations of the country's collaborationist
   nationalist movements during World War II, Poland is not alone,^[95]
   and Poland–Ukraine relations have suffered as a result of a similar law
   in Ukraine that was criticized in Poland for deflecting blame away from
   the Ukrainian Insurgent Army and their massacres of Poles in Volhynia
   and Eastern Galicia.^[96]

   Derussification in Ukraine is a process of removing Russian influence
   from the post-Soviet country of Ukraine. This derussification started
   after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and intensified with the
   demolition of monuments to Lenin during Euromaidan in 2014 and the
   further systemic process of decommunization in Ukraine. The Russian
   invasion of Ukraine gave a strong impetus to the process.^[97]

   In 2024, the city of Vienna rejected a monument to Polish King John III
   Sobieski due to concerns about Islamophobia and anti-Turkish
   sentiment.^[98]
