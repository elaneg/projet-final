   Tissue culture, Microbial food cultures, and Animal culture.
   [250px-Microbial_cultures_fridge.JPG] Microbial cultures on solid and
   liquid media

   A microbiological culture, or microbial culture, is a method of
   multiplying microbial organisms by letting them reproduce in
   predetermined culture medium under controlled laboratory conditions.
   Microbial cultures are foundational and basic diagnostic methods used
   as research tools in molecular biology.

   The term culture can also refer to the microorganisms being grown.

   Microbial cultures are used to determine the type of organism, its
   abundance in the sample being tested, or both. It is one of the primary
   diagnostic methods of microbiology and used as a tool to determine the
   cause of infectious disease by letting the agent multiply in a
   predetermined medium. For example, a throat culture is taken by
   scraping the lining of tissue in the back of the throat and blotting
   the sample into a medium to be able to screen for harmful
   microorganisms, such as Streptococcus pyogenes, the causative agent of
   strep throat.^[1] Furthermore, the term culture is more generally used
   informally to refer to "selectively growing" a specific kind of
   microorganism in the lab.

   It is often essential to isolate a pure culture of microorganisms. A
   pure (or axenic) culture is a population of cells or multicellular
   organisms growing in the absence of other species or types. A pure
   culture may originate from a single cell or single organism, in which
   case the cells are genetic clones of one another. For the purpose of
   gelling the microbial culture, the medium of agarose gel (agar) is
   used. Agar is a gelatinous substance derived from seaweed. A cheap
   substitute for agar is guar gum, which can be used for the isolation
   and maintenance of thermophiles.

History

   [edit]
   Further information: Microbiology § The birth of bacteriology, and
   Bacteria § History of bacteriology

   The first culture media was liquid media, designed by Louis Pasteur in
   1860.^[2] This was used in the laboratory until Robert Koch's
   development of solid media in 1881.^[3] Koch's method of using a flat
   plate for his solid media was replaced by Julius Richard Petri's round
   box in 1887.^[2] Since these foundational inventions, a diverse array
   of media and methods have evolved to help scientists grow, identify,
   and purify cultures of microorganisms.

Types of microbial cultures

   [edit]

Prokaryotic culture

   [edit]

   The culturing of prokaryotes typically involves bacteria, since archaea
   are difficult to culture in a laboratory setting.^[4] To obtain a pure
   prokaryotic culture, one must start the culture from a single cell or a
   single colony of the organism.^[5] Since a prokaryotic colony is the
   asexual offspring of a single cell, all of the cells are genetically
   identical and will result in a pure culture.

Viral culture

   [edit]
   Main article: Viral culture

   Virus and phage cultures require host cells in which the virus or phage
   multiply. For bacteriophages, cultures are grown by infecting bacterial
   cells. The phage can then be isolated from the resulting plaques in a
   lawn of bacteria on a plate. Viral cultures are obtained from their
   appropriate eukaryotic host cells. The streak plate method is a way to
   physically separate the microbial population, and is done by spreading
   the inoculate back and forth with an inoculating loop over the solid
   agar plate. Upon incubation, colonies will arise and single cells will
   have been isolated from the biomass. Once a microorganism has been
   isolated in pure culture, it is necessary to preserve it in a viable
   state for further study and use in cultures called stock cultures.
   These cultures have to be maintained, such that there is no loss of
   their biological, immunological and cultural characters.

Eukaryotic cell culture

   [edit]
   Main article: Cell culture

   Eukaryotic cell cultures provide a controlled environment for studying
   eukaryotic organisms. Single-celled eukaryotes - such as yeast, algae,
   and protozoans - can be cultured in similar ways to prokaryotic
   cultures. The same is true for multicellular microscopic eukaryotes,
   such as C. elegans.

   Although macroscopic eukaryotic organisms are too large to culture in a
   laboratory, cells taken from these organisms can be cultured. This
   allows researchers to study specific parts and processes of a
   macroscopic eukaryote in vitro.

Culture methods

   [edit]
   Main article: Growth medium

   CAPTION: Method overview

   Method Description Uses and advantages
   Liquid/broth cultures Organisms are inoculated into a flask of liquid
   media Growing up large volumes of organism, antimicrobial assays,
   bacterial differentiation
   Agar plates Organisms are placed or streaked onto petri dishes Provides
   a solid surface for stationary growth, compact and stackable
   Agar based dipsticks Essentially miniature agar plates in the form of
   dipsticks Diagnostic purposes, can be used anywhere, cost effective,
   easy to use
   Selective and differential media Organisms are cultured in/on specific
   media to select for or differentiate between certain ones Help identify
   unknown organisms, assist in purifying cultures
   Stab cultures Organisms are inoculated into a test tube of solid agar
   Short-term storage, bacterial differentiation

Liquid cultures

   [edit]

   One method of microbiological culture is liquid culture, in which the
   desired organisms are suspended in a liquid nutrient medium, such as
   Luria broth, in an upright flask. This allows a scientist to grow up
   large amounts of bacteria or other microorganisms for a variety of
   downstream applications.

   Liquid cultures are ideal for preparation of an antimicrobial assay in
   which the liquid broth is inoculated with bacteria and let to grow
   overnight (a ‘shaker’ may be used to mechanically mix the broth, to
   encourage uniform growth). Subsequently, aliquots of the sample are
   taken to test for the antimicrobial activity of a specific drug or
   protein (antimicrobial peptides).
   [250px-Synechococcus_cyanobacteria-cultures.jpg] Liquid cultures of the
   cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC 7002

   Static liquid cultures may be used as an alternative. These cultures
   are not shaken, and they provide the microbes with an oxygen
   gradient.^[6]

Agar plates

   [edit]
   [250px-Diagnostic_algorithm_of_possible_bacterial_infection.png]
   Example of a workup algorithm of possible bacterial infection in cases
   with no specifically requested targets (non-bacteria, mycobacteria
   etc.), with most common situations and agents seen in a New England
   setting. The grey box near top left shows a Venn diagram of what
   culture media are routinely used for various sources or purposes.
   Main article: Agar plate

   Microbiological cultures can be grown in petri dishes of differing
   sizes that have a thin layer of agar-based growth medium. Once the
   growth medium in the petri dish is inoculated with the desired
   bacteria, the plates are incubated at the optimal temperature for the
   growing of the selected bacteria (for example, usually at 37 degrees
   Celsius, or the human body temperature, for cultures from humans or
   animals, or lower for environmental cultures). After the desired level
   of growth is achieved, agar plates can be stored upside down in a
   refrigerator for an extended period of time to keep bacteria for future
   experiments.

   There are a variety of additives that can be added to agar before it is
   poured into a plate and allowed to solidify. Some types of bacteria can
   only grow in the presence of certain additives. This can also be used
   when creating engineered strains of bacteria that contain an
   antibiotic-resistance gene. When the selected antibiotic is added to
   the agar, only bacterial cells containing the gene insert conferring
   resistance will be able to grow. This allows the researcher to select
   only the colonies that were successfully transformed.

Agar based dipsticks

   [edit]

   Miniaturized version of agar plates implemented to dipstick formats,
   e.g. Dip Slide, Digital Dipstick ^[7] show potential to be used at the
   point-of-care for diagnosis purposes. They have advantages over agar
   plates since they are cost effective and their operation does not
   require expertise or laboratory environment, which enable them to be
   used at the point-of-care.

Selective and differential media

   [edit]

   Selective and differential media reveal characteristics about the
   microorganisms being cultured on them. This kind of media can be
   selective, differential, or both selective and differential. Growing a
   culture on multiple kinds of selective and differential media can
   purify mixed cultures and reveal to scientists the characteristics
   needed to identify unknown cultures.

Selective media

   [edit]

   Selective media is used to distinguish organisms by allowing for a
   specific kind of organism to grow on it while inhibiting the growth of
   others. For example, eosin methylene blue (EMB) may be used to select
   against Gram-positive bacteria, most of which have hindered growth on
   EMB, and select for Gram-negative bacteria, whose growth is not
   inhibited on EMB.^[8]

Differential media

   [edit]

   Scientists use differential media when culturing microorganisms to
   reveal certain biochemical characteristics about the organisms. These
   revealed traits can then be compared to attributes of known
   microorganisms in an effort to identify unknown cultures. An example of
   this is MacConkey agar (MAC), which reveals lactose-fermenting bacteria
   through a pH indicator that changes color when acids are produced from
   fermentation.^[9]

Multitarget panels

   [edit]

   On multitarget panels, bacteria isolated from a previously grown colony
   are distributed into each well, each of which contains growth medium as
   well as the ingredients for a biochemical test, which will change the
   absorbance of the well depending on the bacterial property for the
   tested target. The panel will be incubated in a machine, which
   subsequently analyses each well with a light-based method such as
   colorimetry, turbidimetry, or fluorometry.^[10] The combined results
   will be automatically compared to a database of known results for
   various bacterial species, in order to generate a diagnosis of what
   bacterial species is present in the current panel. Simultaneously, it
   performs antibiotic susceptibility testing.
     * Multitarget microbial panel. A small amount of the bacteria to be
       tested is placed in each well, each of which has the ingredients
       for a separate test.

Stab cultures

   [edit]
   [250px-Stab_culture.png] Motile and non-motile bacteria can be
   differentiated along the stab lines. Motile bacteria (left) will grow
   out from the stab line while non-motile bacteria (right) are present
   only along the stab line.

   Stab cultures are similar to agar plates, but are formed by solid agar
   in a test tube. Bacteria is introduced via an inoculation needle or a
   pipette tip being stabbed into the center of the agar. Bacteria grow in
   the punctured area.^[11] Stab cultures are most commonly used for
   short-term storage or shipment of cultures. Additionally, stab cultures
   can reveal characteristics about cultured microorganisms such as
   motility or oxygen requirements.

Solid plate culture of thermophilic microorganisms

   [edit]

   For solid plate cultures of thermophilic microorganisms such as
   Bacillus acidocaldarius, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Thermus aquaticus
   and Thermus thermophilus etc. growing at temperatures of 50 to 70
   degrees C, low acyl clarified gellan gum has been proven to be the
   preferred gelling agent comparing to agar for the counting or isolation
   or both of the above thermophilic bacteria.^[12]

Cell culture collections

   [edit]

   Microbial culture collections focus on the acquisition, authentication,
   production, preservation, cataloguing and distribution of viable
   cultures of standard reference microorganisms, cell lines and other
   materials for research in microbial systematics.^[13]^[14] Culture
   collection are also repositories of type strains.
