   More than 100 days into his return to the White House, the conclusion
   is stark: Donald Trump is no longer the same president he was during
   his first term. His familiar nationalist and populist rhetoric is now
   openly paired with an authoritarian turn – one without precedent in US
   history. He has adopted a neo-imperial view of the economy, treating
   the global order as a zero-sum contest of winners and losers. In this
   worldview, cooperation gives way to domination: what matters is power
   and the accumulation of wealth.

   Having withstood two impeachment procedures, numerous lawsuits and at
   least one assassination attempt, Trump now governs with what can appear
   to be unchecked authority. To his followers, he has become a hero, a
   martyr – almost a messianic figure. He no longer sees democracy as a
   framework to be honoured, but as a tool to legitimize his hold on
   power. His decisive electoral victory now serves as a mandate to cast
   aside institutional limits.

   Three key features define his style of governance: a radical
   centralization of executive power grounded in the theory of the
   “unitary executive”; the politicization of the Department of Justice,
   used as a weapon against rivals; and the manipulation of federal
   authority to target cultural, media and educational institutions. His
   playbook is chaos: unsettle opponents, dominate the media narrative and
   blur the boundaries of democratic norms. Impulsive and reactionary,
   Trump often governs in response to Fox News segments or trending posts
   on Truth Social. Instability has become a strategic tool.

   But Trump is not a historical anomaly. While his 2016 victory may have
   seemed unlikely, his re-election reflects a deeper, long-term
   transformation rooted in the post-Cold War era.

From an external to an internal enemy

   The collapse of the USSR – a structuring external enemy – redirected
   political confrontation toward the designation of an internal enemy.
   The culture war has become the dominant ideological battleground,
   driven by two closely linked forces. On one side, a religious
   radicalization led by nationalist Christian movements – such as the New
   Apostolic Reformation – seeks to roll back social progress and promote
   the vision of an outright theocracy. On the other, growing racial
   anxiety is fueled by fears of white demographic decline and resistance
   to civil rights gains.

   The commentator Pat Buchanan saw it coming as early as the 1990s.
   Speaking at the 1992 Republican National Convention, he warned: “There
   is a cultural war going on for the soul of America… as critical as the
   Cold War itself.” Too radical for his time, Buchanan championed a
   white, Christian, conservative US hostile to cosmopolitan elites.
   Though marginalized then, his ideas laid the groundwork for what would
   become Trumpism.

   Newt Gingrich, who served as Speaker of the House from 1995 to 1999,
   played a pivotal role in reshaping both the Republican party and US
   politics. A Republican group he chaired famously distributed a pamphlet
   to Republican candidates titled “Language: A Key Mechanism of Control”,
   advising them to use uplifting language to describe themselves, and
   inflammatory terms like “corrupt”, “immoral” and “traitor” to describe
   their opponents. This aggressive rhetoric redefined political rivals as
   enemies to be defeated – helping pave the way for a right-wing politics
   in which winning trumps democratic norms.

   At the same time, the rise of a new conservative media ecosystem
   intensified polarization. The launch of Fox News in 1996, the growth of
   right-wing talk radio shows like Rush Limbaugh’s and the later
   explosion of social media gave the US right powerful tools to shape and
   radicalize public opinion. Today, algorithm-driven information bubbles
   trap citizens in alternate realities, where misinformation and outrage
   drown out reasoned debate. This has deepened polarization and fractured
   society as a whole.

Channeling anger

   This ideological and media realignment has unfolded alongside a broader
   crisis: the unraveling of the post-Cold War neoliberal consensus.
   Promises of shared prosperity have been replaced by
   deindustrialization, deepening inequality and widespread resentment.
   Successive traumas – from 9/11 and the 2008 financial crash to the
   Covid-19 pandemic – and foreign wars without real victories have eroded
   public trust in the establishment.

   Trump channels this anger. He offers a vision of a restored and
   idealized America, a rollback of recent social gains, and a reassertion
   of national identity grounded in religion and race. His populism is not
   a coherent ideology but an emotional response – born of perceived
   injustice, humiliation and loss.

   Trump is more than a symptom of America’s democratic crisis: he is its
   most vivid manifestation. He embodies the legacy of the 1990s – a
   foundational decade of identity grievance, culture wars and media
   deregulation. Viewed as a political outsider, he has never been judged
   as a traditional politician, but rather embraced, by some, as the
   archetypal “self-made man” – a successful businessman and reality TV
   celebrity.

   His rhetoric – transgressive, provocative and often cruel – gives voice
   to what had been repressed. The humiliation of opponents becomes part
   of the performance. For his supporters, it’s exhilarating. It breaks
   taboos, flouts political correctness and feeds the fantasy of
   reclaiming a lost America.

   And he’s no longer alone. With the vocal support of economic and tech
   elites like Elon Musk – now a central figure in the radicalized right
   on X – Trumpism has entered a new phase. Together, they’ve outlined a
   new kind of authoritarian, cultural and digital power, where influence
   matters more than institutions.

   The US re-elected not just a man, but a style, an era and a worldview
   built on dominance, disruption and disdain for rules. Still, history is
   unwritten: intoxicated by hubris and undermined by incompetence,
   Trumpism may yet crash into the wall of reality – with consequences far
   beyond America’s borders.
