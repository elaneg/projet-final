   Evolutionary theory of social change
   This article is about evolutionary theories of social change. For other
   uses, see Cultural evolution (disambiguation).
   [250px-Bicycle_evolution-numbers.svg.png] Cultural evolution

   Cultural evolution is an evolutionary theory of social change. It
   follows from the definition of culture as "information capable of
   affecting individuals' behavior that they acquire from other members of
   their species through teaching, imitation and other forms of social
   transmission".^[1] Cultural evolution is the change of this information
   over time.^[2] This theoretical framework uses concepts like cultural
   variants, transmission mechanisms, and selective pressures to model how
   ideas, behaviors, and technologies spread and change over time,
   enabling rapid adaptation beyond purely genetic means.

   Cultural evolution, historically also known as sociocultural evolution,
   was originally developed in the 19th century by anthropologists
   stemming from Charles Darwin's research on evolution. Today, cultural
   evolution has become the basis for a growing field of scientific
   research in the social sciences, including anthropology, economics,
   psychology, and organizational studies. Previously, it was believed
   that social change resulted from biological adaptations;
   anthropologists now commonly accept that social changes arise in
   consequence of a combination of social, environmental, and biological
   influences (viewed from a nature vs nurture framework).^[3]^[4]

   There have been a number of different approaches to the study of
   cultural evolution, including dual inheritance theory, sociocultural
   evolution, memetics, cultural evolutionism, and other variants on
   cultural selection theory. The approaches differ not just in the
   history of their development and discipline of origin but in how they
   conceptualize the process of cultural evolution and the assumptions,
   theories, and methods that they apply to its study. There has been a
   convergence of the cluster of related theories towards seeing cultural
   evolution as a unified discipline in its own right.^[5]^[6]

History

   [edit]
   Main article: Sociocultural evolution

   Aristotle thought that development of cultural form (such as poetry)
   stops when it reaches its maturity.^[7] James Gleick quotes a 1873
   essay in Harper's New Monthly Magazine: "By the principle which Darwin
   describes as natural selection short words are gaining the advantage
   over long words, direct forms of expression are gaining the advantage
   over indirect, words of precise meaning the advantage of the ambiguous,
   and local idioms are everywhere in disadvantage."^[8]

   Cultural evolution, in the Darwinian sense of variation and selective
   inheritance, could be said to trace back to Darwin himself.^[9] Darwin
   argued for both customs (1874 p. 239) and "inherited habits" as
   contributing to human evolution, grounding both in the innate capacity
   for acquiring language.^[10]^[9]^[11]

   Darwin's ideas, along with those of such as Comte (1798-1857) and
   Quetelet (1796-1874), influenced a number of what would now be called
   social scientists in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries.
   Hodgson and Knudsen^[12] single out David George Ritchie (1853-1903)
   and Thorstein Veblen (1857-1929), crediting the former with
   anticipating both dual inheritance theory and universal Darwinism.
   Despite the stereotypical image of social Darwinism that developed
   later in the century, neither Ritchie nor Veblen were^[citation needed]
   on the political right.

   The early years of the 20th century and particularly the period of
   World War I (1914 to 1918) saw biological concepts and metaphors
   shunned by most social sciences. Even uttering the word evolution
   carried "serious risk to one's intellectual reputation".^[13] Darwinian
   ideas were also in decline following the rediscovery of Mendelian
   genetics, but figures such as Fisher, Haldane, and Wright revived them,
   developing the first population genetic models and (as it became known)
   the "modern synthesis".

   Cultural evolutionary concepts, or even metaphors, revived more slowly.
   If there were one influential individual in the revival it was probably
   Donald T. Campbell. In 1960^[14] he drew on Wright to draw a parallel
   between genetic evolution and the "blind variation and selective
   retention" of creative ideas; work that developed into a full theory of
   "socio-cultural evolution" in 1965^[15] (a work that includes
   references to other works in the then current revival of interest in
   the field). Campbell (1965 26) was clear that he perceived cultural
   evolution not as an analogy "from organic evolution per se, but rather
   from a general model for quasiteleological processes for which organic
   evolution is but one instance".

   Others pursued more specific analogies notably the anthropologist F. T.
   (Ted) Cloak who argued in 1975^[16] for the existence of learnt
   cultural instructions (cultural corpuscles or i-culture) resulting in
   material artefacts (m-culture) such as wheels.^[17] The argument
   thereby introduced as to whether cultural evolution requires
   neurological instructions continues to the present day ^[citation
   needed].

Unilinear theory

   [edit]

   In the 19th century cultural evolution was thought to follow a
   unilineal pattern whereby all cultures progressively develop over time.
   The underlying assumption was that Cultural Evolution itself led to the
   growth and development of civilization.^[3]^[18]^[19]

   Thomas Hobbes in the 17th century declared indigenous culture to have
   "no arts, no letters, no society" and he described facing life as
   "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." He, like other scholars of
   his time, reasoned that everything positive and esteemed resulted from
   the slow development away from this poor lowly state of being.^[3]

   Under the theory of unilinear Cultural Evolution, all societies and
   cultures develop on the same path. The first to present a general
   unilineal theory was Herbert Spencer. Spencer suggested that humans
   develop into more complex beings as culture progresses, where people
   originally lived in "undifferentiated hordes" culture progresses and
   develops to the point where civilization develops hierarchies. The
   concept behind unilinear theory is that the steady accumulation of
   knowledge and culture leads to the separation of the various modern day
   sciences and the build-up of cultural norms present in modern-day
   society.^[3]^[18]

   In Lewis H. Morgan's book Ancient Society (1877), Morgan labels seven
   differing stages of human culture: lower, middle, and upper savagery;
   lower, middle, and upper barbarism; and civilization. He justifies this
   staging classification by referencing societies whose cultural traits
   resembled those of each of his stage classifications of the cultural
   progression. Morgan gave no example of lower savagery, as even at the
   time of writing few examples remained of this cultural type. At the
   time of expounding his theory, Morgan's work was highly respected and
   became a foundation for much of anthropological study that was to
   follow.^[3]^[18]^[19]

Cultural particularism

   [edit]

   There began a widespread condemnation of unilinear theory in the late
   19th century. Unilinear cultural evolution implicitly assumes that
   culture was borne out of the United States and Western Europe. That was
   seen by many to be racist, as it assumed that some individuals and
   cultures were more evolved than others.^[3]

   Franz Boas, a German-born anthropologist, was the instigator of the
   movement known as 'cultural particularism' in which the emphasis
   shifted to a multilinear approach to cultural evolution. That differed
   to the unilinear approach that used to be favoured in the sense that
   cultures were no longer compared, but they were assessed uniquely.
   Boas, along with several of his pupils, notably A.L. Kroeber, Ruth
   Benedict and Margaret Mead, changed the focus of anthropological
   research to the effect that instead of generalizing cultures, the
   attention was now on collecting empirical evidence of how individual
   cultures change and develop.^[3]

Multilinear theory

   [edit]

   Cultural particularism dominated popular thought for the first half of
   the 20th century before American anthropologists, including Leslie A.
   White, Julian H. Steward, Marshall D. Sahlins, and Elman R. Service,
   revived the debate on cultural evolution. These theorists were the
   first to introduce the idea of multilinear cultural evolution.^[3]

   Under multilinear theory, there are no fixed stages (as in unilinear
   theory) towards cultural development. Instead, there are several stages
   of differing lengths and forms. Although, individual cultures develop
   differently and cultural evolution occurs differently, multilinear
   theory acknowledges that cultures and societies do tend to develop and
   move forward.^[3]^[20]

   Leslie A. White focused on the idea that different cultures had
   differing amounts of 'energy', White argued that with greater energy
   societies could possess greater levels of social differentiation. He
   rejected separation of modern societies from primitive societies. In
   contrast, Steward argued, much like Darwin's theory of evolution, that
   culture adapts to its surroundings. 'Evolution and Culture' by Sahlins
   and Service is an attempt to condense the views of White and Steward
   into a universal theory of multilinear evolution.^[3]

   Robert Wright recognized the inevitable development of cultures. He
   proposed that population growth was a crucial component of cultural
   evolution. Population has a symbiotic relationship with technological,
   economic, and political development.^[21]

Memetics

   [edit]
   Main article: Memetics

   Richard Dawkins' 1976 book The Selfish Gene proposed the concept of the
   "meme", which is analogous to that of the gene. A meme is an
   idea-replicator that can reproduce itself, by jumping from mind to mind
   via the process of one human learning from another via imitation. Along
   with the "virus of the mind" image, the meme might be thought of as a
   "unit of culture" (an idea, belief, pattern of behaviour, etc.), which
   spreads among the individuals of a population. The variation and
   selection in the copying process enables Darwinian evolution among
   memeplexes and therefore is a candidate for a mechanism of cultural
   evolution. As memes are "selfish" in that they are "interested" only in
   their own success, they could well be in conflict with their biological
   host's genetic interests. Consequently, a "meme's eye" view might
   account for certain evolved cultural traits, such as suicide terrorism,
   that are successful at spreading the meme of martyrdom, but fatal to
   their hosts and often other people.

Evolutionary epistemology

   [edit]
   Main article: Evolutionary epistemology

   "Evolutionary epistemology" can also refer to a theory that applies the
   concepts of biological evolution to the growth of human knowledge and
   argues that units of knowledge themselves, particularly scientific
   theories, evolve according to selection. In that case, a theory, like
   the germ theory of disease, becomes more or less credible according to
   changes in the body of knowledge surrounding it.

   One of the hallmarks of evolutionary epistemology is the notion that
   empirical testing alone does not justify the pragmatic value of
   scientific theories but rather that social and methodological processes
   select those theories with the closest "fit" to a given problem. The
   mere fact that a theory has survived the most rigorous empirical tests
   available does not, in the calculus of probability, predict its ability
   to survive future testing. Karl Popper used Newtonian physics as an
   example of a body of theories so thoroughly confirmed by testing as to
   be considered unassailable, but they were nevertheless improved on by
   Albert Einstein's bold insights into the nature of space-time. For the
   evolutionary epistemologist, all theories are true only provisionally,
   regardless of the degree of empirical testing they have survived.

   Mny consider that Popper gave evolutionary epistemology its first
   comprehensive treatment, but Donald T. Campbell had coined the phrase
   in 1974.^[22]

Dual inheritance theory

   [edit]
   This section is an excerpt from Dual inheritance theory.[edit]

   Dual inheritance theory (DIT), also known as gene–culture coevolution
   or biocultural evolution,^[23] was developed in the 1960s through early
   1980s to explain how human behavior is a product of two different and
   interacting evolutionary processes: genetic evolution and cultural
   evolution. Genes and culture continually interact in a feedback
   loop:^[24] changes in genes can lead to changes in culture which can
   then influence genetic selection, and vice versa. One of the theory's
   central claims is that culture evolves partly through a Darwinian
   selection process, which dual inheritance theorists often describe by
   analogy to genetic evolution.^[25]

Criticism and controversy

   [edit]

   As a relatively new and growing scientific field, cultural evolution is
   undergoing much formative debate. Some of the prominent conversations
   are revolving around universal Darwinism,^[15]^[26] dual inheritance
   theory,^[27] and memetics.^[28]^[29]^[30]^[31]

   Cultural evolution has drawn conversations from multi-disciplinary
   sources with movement towards a unified view between the natural and
   social sciences. There remains some accusation of biological
   reductionism, as opposed to cultural naturalism, and scientific efforts
   are often mistakenly associated with Social Darwinism. However, some
   useful parallels between biological and social evolution still appear
   to be found.^[32]

   Researchers Alberto Acerbi and Alex Mesoudi's criticism of Cultural
   Evolution lies in the ambiguity surrounding the analogy between
   cultural and genetic evolution. They clarify the distinction between
   cultural selection (high-fidelity replication of traits) and cultural
   attraction (reconstruction of traits with lower fidelity). They argue
   that both mechanisms coexist in cultural evolution, making it essential
   to empirically determine their prevalence in different contexts,
   addressing confusion in the field.^[33]

Criticism of historic approaches to cultural evolution

   [edit]

   Cultural evolution has been criticized over the past two centuries that
   it has advanced its development into the form it holds today. Morgan's
   theory of evolution implies that all cultures follow the same basic
   pattern. Human culture is not linear, different cultures develop in
   different directions and at differing paces, and it is not satisfactory
   or productive to assume cultures develop in the same way.^[34]

   A further key critique of cultural evolutionism is what is known as
   "armchair anthropology". The name results from the fact that many of
   the anthropologists advancing theories had not seen first hand the
   cultures they were studying. The research and data collected was
   carried out by explorers and missionaries as opposed to the
   anthropologists themselves. Edward Tylor was the epitome of that and
   did very little of his own research.^[30]^[34] Cultural evolution is
   also criticized for being ethnocentric; cultures are still seen as
   attempting to emulate western civilization. Under ethnocentricity,
   primitive societies are said to not yet be at the cultural levels of
   other Western societies.^[34]^[35]

   Much of the criticism aimed at cultural evolution is focused on the
   unilinear approach to social change. Broadly speaking in the second
   half of the 20th century the criticisms of cultural evolution have been
   answered by the multilinear theory. Ethnocentricity, for example, is
   more prevalent under the unilinear theory.^[34]^[30]^[35]

   Some approaches, such as dual inheritance theory, make use of empirical
   methods including psychological and animal studies, field site
   research, and computational models.^[36]

Machine culture

   [edit]

   With the advent of increasingly pervasive and capable artificial
   intelligence, Brinkmann et al. (2023)^[37] argue that intelligent
   machines will increasingly shape cultural evolution by impacting the
   key Darwinian properties of culture (variation, transmission, and
   selection).
