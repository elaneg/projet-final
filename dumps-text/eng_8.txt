   Organizational culture encompasses the shared norms, values, and
   behaviors in organizations reflecting their core values and strategic
   direction.^[1]^[2] Alternative terms include business culture,
   corporate culture and company culture.^[3] The term corporate culture
   emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s.^[4]^[a] It was used by
   managers, sociologists, and organizational theorists in the
   1980s.^[6]^[7]

   Organizational culture influences how people interact, how decisions
   are made (or avoided), the context within which cultural artifacts are
   created, employee attachment, the organization's competitive advantage,
   and the internal alignment of its units. It is distinct from national
   culture or the broader cultural background of its workforce.

   A related topic, organizational identity, refers to statements and
   images which are important to an organization and helps to
   differentiate itself from other organizations. An organization may also
   have its own management philosophy. Organizational identity influences
   all stakeholders, leaders and employees alike.^[8]

Definition

   [edit]

   Various definitions exist, without consensus. Lesley Willcoxson and
   Bruce Millett note that organizational cultures can be described in
   similar ways to wider forms of culture such as national culture.^[9]
   Some of the definitions offered include:
     * Writers Terrence E. Deal and Allan A. Kennedy defined
       organizational culture as "the way things get done around
       here".^[10]
     * According to Elliott Jaques, the culture of a factory "is its
       customary and traditional way of thinking and doing of things,
       which is shared to a greater or lesser degree by all its members,
       and which new members must learn, and at least partially accept, in
       order to be accepted into service in the firm".^[11]
     * Edgar Schein defined it as including a shared "pattern of basic
       assumptions" that group members acquired over time as they learn to
       cope with internal and external organizationally relevant
       problems.^[12]
     * Ravasi and Schultz characterized it as a set of shared assumptions
       that guide behaviors.^[13] It is also the pattern of such
       collective behaviors and assumptions that are taught to new
       organizational members as a way of perceiving, thinking, and
       feeling.^[14]
     * Schein,^[15] Deal and Kennedy,^[10] and Kotter^[16] advanced the
       idea that cultures are diverse and may encompass subcultures linked
       to an individual management teams.^[17]
     * Ravasi and Schultz^[18] and Allaire and Firsirotu^[19] claim that
       organizational culture represents the collective values, beliefs
       and principles of organizational members. It is influenced by
       factors such as history, type of product, market, technology,
       strategy, type of employees, management style, and national
       culture. Culture includes the organization's vision, values, norms,
       systems, symbols, language, assumptions, environment, location,
       beliefs and habits.^[20]^[21]^[22]^[23] Gallup reported that just
       22% of U.S. employees feel connected to their organization's
       culture.^[24]
     * Geert Hofstede defined organizational culture as "the collective
       programming of the mind which distinguishes the members of one
       organization from another".^[25]
     * McHale defines culture as "how the organization functions and its
       deeply embedded patterns".^[26]

History

   [edit]

   Elliott Jaques introduced the concept in his 1951 book The Changing
   Culture of a Factory.^[27] The book was a published report of "a case
   study of developments in the social life of one industrial community
   between April, 1948 and November 1950".^[11] The case involved a
   publicly-held British company engaged principally in the manufacture,
   sale, and servicing of metal bearings. The study concerned itself with
   the description, analysis, and development of corporate group
   behaviors.^[28]

Analysis

   [edit]

   Researchers have proposed various dimensions individually and in
   combination as useful for analyzing organizational culture. Examples
   include external/internal, strong/weak, flexible/rigid, and many
   others.

Insularity

   [edit]

   Culture can be externally focused, aiming to satisfy customers,
   investors, and partners. Alternatively, they can be internally focused,
   aiming to satisfy employees, comply with union-imposed rules, or to
   meet conduct standards around issues such as diversity, equity, and
   inclusion.^[29] Many organizations lie between such extremes,
   attempting to balance the needs of multiple stakeholders.

Strength

   [edit]

   Any type of culture can be strongly or only tacitly supported. A strong
   culture is characterized by reinforcing tools such as ceremonies and
   policies to instill and spread it.^[30]^[predatory publisher] The
   intent is to secure group compliance.^[31]

   Researchers generally report that organizations having strong cultures
   are more successful.^[32]^[33]

   An employee's perception of the organization's culture can have an
   impact on the employee's longevity with the organization. When
   organizations create a positive environment for their employees, they
   experience professional fulfillment, boosted performance, and a longer
   stint with the organization.^[34]

Risks

   [edit]

   Tension arises when cultural (personal) and organizational identities
   do not match well because corporate policies, work practices, and
   communication styles conflict with local customs, for example in terms
   of formal vs. informal work environments, direct vs. indirect
   communication, and individualistic vs. collectivist
   approaches.^[35]^[36]^[37]

   Quiet quitting is a principle that could potentially affect
   organizations with negative culture. It is the idea of doing the bare
   minimum on a job and setting boundaries in response to poor culture,
   burnout, lack of recognition, and inadequate work-life balance. This
   occurs in unhealthy work environments where personal circumstances
   force employees to stay.^[38]

Cultural

   [edit]
   See also: Cross-cultural differences in decision-making and
   Cross-cultural psychology

   Organizational culture is used to control, coordinate, and integrate
   distinct groups across the organization.^[39] Differences in national
   cultures must be addressed.^[40] Such differences include
   organizational structure and manager/employee relationships.^[41]

Groupthink

   [edit]

   Irving Janis defined groupthink as "a mode of thinking that people
   engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when
   the members' strivings for unanimity override their motivation to
   realistically appraise alternative courses of action."^[42] This is a
   state in which even if group members have different ideas, they do not
   challenge the group. Groupthink can lead to lack of creativity and
   decisions made without critical evaluation.^[43] Hogg and separately
   Deanne et al. stated that groupthink can occur, for example, when group
   members rely heavily on a charismatic figure or where members evince an
   "evangelical"^[44]^[45] belief in the organization's values. Groupthink
   can also occur in groups characterized by a friendly climate conducive
   to conflict avoidance.

Five Monkeys Experiment

   [edit]

   Since the late 1960s, the so-called "Five Monkeys Experiment", which
   serves to exemplify the adverse effects of unquestioned traditions, has
   become part of management lore, often titled "How Company Policy Is
   Made".^[46] It imagines a situation where five monkeys are in a cage
   with a banana tied to the ceiling. Whenever a monkey climbs to reach
   the banana, all five are sprayed with cold water. The group quickly
   learn to ignore the banana and punish any monkey who attempts to reach
   for it. If one monkey is removed from the cage and replaced with a
   newcomer, they too are punished for reaching for the banana. If every
   monkey is subsequently replaced in this manner, so that none present
   remember being sprayed with cold water, the group will supposedly
   continue to punish any attempts to reach the banana. The monkeys are
   perpetuating a caution that may be redundant "because that's the way
   it's always been around here".^[46]

Rigidity and adaptability

   [edit]

   Willcoxson and Millett note that organizational cultures change over
   time.^[9]^: 93  Kotter and Heskett define an adaptive culture as
   characterized by managers who pay close attention to their
   constituencies, especially customers, initiating change when needed,
   and taking risks. They claim that organizations with adaptive cultures
   perform better.^[16]

Bullying

   [edit]

   Main articles: Bullying culture and Workplace bullying

   Bullying manifests in workplaces that allow employees of higher status
   to harass those of lower status. This generally requires support or at
   least forbearance from company leaders.^[47] Bullying can cascade down
   the organizational hierarchy as supervisors experiencing bullying
   display the same behavior to their subordinates.^[48]

   Workplace bullying impacts employees leading to increased stress on the
   job, decreased productivity and high turnover rates. Employees who are
   bullied often remain silent because management fails to hold
   perpetrators accountable.^[49]

COVID-19 impact

   [edit]

   The pandemic led many organizations to incorporate limiting spread into
   their cultures as a collective responsibility. Responses focused on
   requiring vaccines, hygiene, and masking.

   In Asia, mask-wearing was part of several national cultures predating
   the pandemic.^[50] This was driven by experience with prior flus in
   Asia, such as Spanish flu, Hong Kong flu, Avian flu, and Swine flu, in
   addition to SARS, as well as various affronts to air quality such as
   volcanic eruptions.^[51]

   Somers categorized cultures based on whether the need of the individual
   or the group was foremost. He used behaviors such as mask-wearing to
   measure collectivism vs individualism.^[52] Cultures otherwise rated
   "strong" were relatively resistant to change during the pandemic.^[53]
   However, strong cultures that emphasized innovation were more willing
   to change.

   Mandated interventions could be seen by members either as attempts to
   protect them or to as attempts to exert control despite limited
   effectiveness, depending on how they were presented.^[54]

   Digital tools such as videoconferencing, screen-sharing, file sharing,
   shared document authoring, digital whiteboards, and chat groups became
   widely accepted, replacing in-person meetings. The reduced amount of
   face-to-face communications may have impacted organizational cultures.
   New members, lacking face time with others, experienced difficulty in
   adapting to their organization's culture. The loss of face-time
   affected existing employees as well, directly weakening cultures, in
   addition to the indirect effects that strengthened or weakened cultures
   as organizations reacted in various ways to the pandemic. Some members
   felt disengaged and expendable rather than essential, alienated, and
   exhausted.^[55]

   Sull and Sull reported that employees rated their leadership higher
   given honest/open communication, integrity, and transparency more than
   in preceding years. Also, employers and leaders giving more attention
   to employees' welfare had a positive impact on cultural adherence.^[56]
   Chambers claimed that this was a short-term response rather than a
   culture change.^[57]

   Deloitte argued that employees displayed greater sense of purpose,
   inspiration, and contribution. Also, leaders became more tolerant of
   employees' failure because of a significant increase in experimentation
   and risk-taking.^[58]

   Daum and Maraist claimed that sense of purpose relates to customers and
   the society of which employees are part. They compared hospitals and
   retail shops. The former had a greater sense of purpose during the
   pandemic, while the latter had less.^[59]

Indicators

   [edit]

   Healthy cultures address members' concerns about the well-being of the
   organization. Whistleblowing, particularly when it damages a company's
   reputation, is considered to be a sign of a dysfunctional corporate
   culture, indicating that internal methods of addressing problems are
   inadequate.^[60]

Intended effects

   [edit]

   Numerous outcomes have been associated either directly or indirectly
   with organizational culture. The relationships between organizational
   culture and various outcomes include organizational performance,
   employee commitment, and innovation. A healthy and robust
   organizational culture is thought to offer various benefits,
   including:^[61]^[62]
     * Competitive edge derived from innovation and customer service
     * Consistent efficient employee performance
     * Team cohesiveness
     * High employee morale and job satisfaction^[63]
     * Alignment towards goal achievement
     * Increased member conscientiousness, leading to better compliance
       with procedures such as information security, and workplace
       safety^[64]^[65]

   A Harvard Business School study reported that culture has a significant
   effect on an organization's long-term economic performance. The study
   examined the management practices at 160 organizations over ten years
   and found that culture can impact performance. Performance-oriented
   cultures experienced better financial results. Additionally, a 2002
   Corporate Leadership Council study found that cultural traits such as
   risk taking, internal communications, and flexibility are important
   drivers of performance. Furthermore, innovativeness, productivity
   through people, and other cultural factors cited by Peters and Waterman
   in In Search of Excellence also have positive economic consequences.

   Denison, Haaland, and Goelzer reported that culture contributes to the
   success of the organization, but not all dimensions contribute equally.
   Effects differed across nations, implying that organizational culture
   is rooted in national culture.^[66]

Culture change

   [edit]

   Cultures are not static and can evolve over time, either organically or
   through intentional change efforts by management.^[67] Culture change
   may be attempted to reduce member turnover, influence behavior, make
   improvements to the organization, reset objectives, rescale the
   organization, or achieve specific results.^[68]

Stages

   [edit]

   Organizational cultures have been reported to change in stages.
   Organizational communication professor Dave Logan proposed five
   stages:^[69]^[70]
     * "Life sucks" (a subsystem severed from other functional systems;
       such as a tribe, gang or prison—2 percent of population);
     * "My life sucks" (—25 percent of population);
     * "I'm great, and you're not" (—48 percent of population);
     * "We are great, but other groups suck" ^[verification needed]
       (unification around more than individual competence—22 percent of
       population) and
     * "Life is great" (3 percent of population).

Obstacles

   [edit]

   Existing culture can hinder change efforts, especially where members
   understand the roles that they are supposed to play. Marquis et al.
   claimed that 70% of all change efforts fail because of the members.
   Organizational culture, and the structures in which they are embedded,
   often exhibit substantial inertia.^[71]

Obstacles to Cultural Change in Public Sector HRM

   [edit]

   Cultural change in public sector organizations presents distinct
   challenges due to the structural, political, and behavioral
   characteristics of government institutions. Unlike private enterprises,
   public agencies operate within rigid bureaucratic frameworks, are
   subject to political oversight, and often face resource constraints
   that limit their capacity for sustained transformation.^[72]

   One of the most significant obstacles is bureaucratic rigidity. Public
   sector organizations are typically governed by formal rules,
   hierarchical structures, and standardized procedures designed to ensure
   accountability and fairness. While these features serve important
   democratic functions, they can also inhibit flexibility and
   responsiveness.^[72] Christensen and Lægreid argue that the
   institutional logic of bureaucracy often clashes with the adaptive
   demands of cultural change, making it difficult to introduce new values
   or behaviors that deviate from established norms.^[72]

   Political pressures further complicate cultural change initiatives.
   Public agencies are embedded in political systems where leadership
   turnover, shifting policy priorities, and electoral cycles can disrupt
   long-term reform efforts.^[73] Pollitt and Bouckaert note that cultural
   change requires continuity and strategic alignment, yet public managers
   often operate under short-term mandates that prioritize immediate
   results over deep transformation.

   Resource limitations are another persistent barrier. Many public sector
   organizations face budget constraints, staffing shortages, and
   competing priorities that restrict their ability to invest in cultural
   change programs.^[74] Initiatives such as training, mentoring, and
   organizational redesign require time and funding, yet these are often
   deprioritized in favor of operational demands.^[74]

   Employee resistance also plays a critical role in shaping the
   trajectory of cultural change. Public sector employees may be deeply
   attached to existing routines, role identities, and organizational
   traditions. Change initiatives that challenge these foundations can
   provoke anxiety, skepticism, or disengagement.^[75]

   Ogbonna and Harris argue that entrenched cultural norms and structural
   inertia contribute to high failure rates in organizational change
   efforts, particularly when new values are not reinforced through
   leadership modeling and performance systems.^[75]

   In addition, leadership gaps can undermine cultural change. Effective
   transformation requires leaders who not only endorse new values but
   also embody them in daily practice. In the public sector, however,
   leadership may be constrained by political appointments, administrative
   turnover, or limited autonomy.^[76]

   Without consistent and visible support from senior leaders, cultural
   change efforts risk being perceived as superficial or temporary. Schein
   highlights the importance of leadership in shaping and sustaining
   organizational culture, noting that symbolic actions and behavioural
   modelling are essential for embedding new norms.^[76]

   Finally, evaluation and feedback mechanisms are often underdeveloped in
   public sector HRM. Cultural change requires ongoing assessment to
   identify progress, surface any resistance, and adjust strategies
   accordingly. Yet many public agencies lack the tools or capacity to
   conduct meaningful evaluations of cultural initiatives.^[74]

   Without data-driven insights, it becomes difficult to refine
   interventions or demonstrate impact, which can erode support and
   momentum.^[74]

Methods

   [edit]

   Change methodologies include Peter Senge's concept of a "learning
   organization" expressed in The Fifth Discipline or Directive
   Communication's "corporate culture evolution".

   Changing culture takes time. Members need time to get used to the new
   ways. Organizations with a strong and specific culture are harder to
   change.^[77]

   Prior to introducing a cultural change, a needs assessment can
   characterize the existing culture. This involves some mixture of employ
   surveys, interviews, focus groups, observation, customer surveys, and
   other internal research. The company must then describe the new,
   desired culture, and then design a change process.

   Cummings and Worley offer six guidelines for cultural change, in line
   with the eight distinct stages mentioned by Kotter.^[78]^[79]
     * Formulate a strategic vision (Kotter stage 1, 2, and 3). A clear
       vision of the firm's new strategy, shared values and behaviors
       provides direction for the culture change.^[80]
     * Display top-management commitment (stage 4). Culture change must be
       managed from the top of the organization, as senior management's
       willingness to change is an important indicator.^[80] Leadership
       must be strongly in favor of the change to implement the change. De
       Caluwé and Vermaak provide a framework with five different ways of
       thinking about change.^[81]
     * Model change at the highest level (stage 5). In order to show that
       management wants the change, the change has to be visible and
       notable. Leadership needs to express the values and behaviors to be
       realized. It is important that leadership acknowledge the strengths
       of the current culture; it must be made clear that the culture
       needs adjustments rather than radical
       changes.^[10]^[82]^[83]^[84]^[85] This process may include creating
       committees, task forces, or value managers. Change agents
       communicate the new culture. They must embody courage, flexibility,
       interpersonal skills, organization knowledge, and patience. These
       individuals must be catalysts, rather than dictators.^[86]
     * The fourth step is to modify the organization to support change.
       This includes identifying systems, policies, procedures and rules
       accordingly. This may include changes to accountability systems,
       compensation, benefits/reward structures, and recruitment and
       retention programs.
     * Select and socialize newcomers and expel deviants (stage 7 and
       8).^[79] A way to implement a change is to connect it to
       organizational membership. People may have to be selected and
       terminated in terms of their fit with the new culture.^[87]
       Encouraging employee motivation and loyalty is key and creates a
       healthy culture. Change managers must be able to connect the
       desired behavior and organizational success. Training must be
       provided to employees.
     * Develop ethical and legal sensitivity. Changes in culture can lead
       to tensions between organizational and individual interests, which
       can create legal problems for practitioners. This is particularly
       relevant for changes in integrity, control, equitable treatment and
       job security.^[87] An evaluation process monitors progress and
       identifies areas that need further development. This step surfaces
       obstacles and resistant members, and acknowledges and rewards
       improvement, which encourages change. It may be necessary to
       incorporate new change managers, such as outside consultants.
       People often resist change, leaving it to leadership to convince
       people that gains outweigh losses. Besides institutionalization,
       reification is another process that tends to occur in strong
       cultures. The organization may come to be regarded as a source of
       pride, and even unique. The organization's members develop a strong
       bond that transcends material returns, and begin to identify with
       it, turning the organization into a sort of clan.

Critical views

   [edit]

   Criticism of "organizational culture" began in the early 1980s.^[7]
   Most criticism comes from writers in critical management studies who
   for example express skepticism about functionalist and unitarist views.
   They stress the ways in which these assumptions can stifle dissent and
   reproduce propaganda and ideology. They suggest that organizations do
   not embody a single culture (diversity), and cultural engineering may
   not reflect the interests of all stakeholders.

   Parker suggested that many of the assumptions surrounding
   organizational culture are not new. They reflect a long-standing
   tension between cultural and structural (or informal and formal)
   versions of organizations. Further, it is reasonable to suggest that
   complex organizations might have many cultures, and that such
   sub-cultures might overlap and contradict each other. The neat
   typologies of cultural forms found in textbooks rarely acknowledge such
   complexities, or the various economic contradictions that exist in
   capitalist organizations.^[88]

   Smircich criticized theories that attempt to categorize or 'pigeonhole'
   organizational culture.^[6]^[89] She applied the metaphor of a plant
   root to represent culture, saying that it drives organizations rather
   than vice versa. Organizations are the product of their organizational
   culture, which shapes behavior and interaction. While Schein's
   underlying assumptions are that beliefs, perceptions, thoughts, and
   feelings are taken for granted and can be observed and considered the
   ultimate source of values and action. However, such assumptions
   undermine attempts to categorize and define organizational
   culture.^[90]

Legal liability

   [edit]

   In the US, corporate culture can legally be found to be a cause of
   injuries and a reason for fining companies, such as when the US
   Department of Labor Mine Safety and Health Administration levied a fine
   of more than US$10.8 million on Performance Coal Co. following the
   Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in April 2010. This was the largest fine
   in the history of this agency.^[91]

Subcultures

   [edit]

   Groups within the organization may act according to their own
   subcultures that are not fully aligned with that of the organization as
   a whole. For example, computer technicians will have expertise,
   language and behaviors gained independently of the organization, but
   their presence can influence the culture of the larger organization.

Shadow side

   [edit]

   Egan and Tate speak of organizations having a "shadow side",^[92] which
   Egan defined as:

     All those things that substantially and consistently affect the
     productivity and quality of the working life of a business, for
     better or worse, but which are not found on organisation charts, in
     company manuals, or in the discussions that take place in formal
     meetings.^[93]

   Tate describes the shadow side as the "often disagreeable, messy, crazy
   and opaque aspects of [an] organisation's personality".^[92]

Notes

    1. ^ Unlike many expressions that emerge in business jargon, the term
       spread to newspapers and magazines. Few usage experts object to the

       management style is a reversal of GE's traditional corporate
       culture, in which virtually everything the company does is measured
       in some form and filed away somewhere."^[5]
