   with the more specific term plant tissue culture being used for plants.
   The term "tissue culture" was coined by American pathologist Montrose
   several days, establishing the basic principle of tissue culture. In
   Gottlieb Haberlandt first pointed out the possibilities of the culture
   of isolated tissues, plant tissue  | culture | .^[4] He suggested that the
   potentialities of individual cells via tissue culture as well as that
   tissue and cell culture have been realized, leading to significant

   In modern usage, "Tissue  | culture | " generally refers to the growth of
   line. The cells are bathed in a  | culture |  medium, which contains
   survival.^[8] Thus, in its broader sense, "tissue culture" is often
   used interchangeably with "cell  | culture | ". On the other hand, the strict
   meaning of "tissue culture" refers to the culturing of tissue pieces,
   i.e. explant  | culture | .
   Tissue culture is an important tool for the study of the biology of
   manipulated and analysed. In animal tissue culture, cells may be grown
   as two-dimensional monolayers (conventional culture) or within fibrous
   tissue-like structures (3D  | culture | ). Eric Simon, in a 1988 NIH SBIR

   There are three common methods to establish cell culture from animals.
   The first is organ culture where whole organs from embryos or partial
   adult organs are used to initiate the organ culture in vitro. These

   three types: (1) precursor cell  | culture | , i.e. undifferentiated cells
   that are to be differentiate, (2) differentiated cell culture, i.e.
