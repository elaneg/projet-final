   with the more specific term plant tissue culture being used for plants.
   In practice, the term "cell  | culture | " now refers to the culturing of
   in contrast with other types of  | culture |  that also grow cells, such as
   plant tissue culture, fungal  | culture | , and microbiological culture (of
   microbes). The historical development and methods of cell culture are
   closely interrelated with those of tissue culture and organ culture.
   Viral culture is also related, with cells as hosts for the viruses.

   often used interchangeably with "cell culture". On the other hand, the
   strict meaning of "tissue  | culture | " refers to the culturing of tissue
   pieces, i.e. explant  | culture | .
   Tissue culture is an important tool for the study of the biology of
   manipulated and analysed. In animal tissue culture, cells may be grown
   as two-dimensional monolayers (conventional culture) or within fibrous
   tissue-like structures (3D  | culture | ). A 1988 NIH SBIR grant report
