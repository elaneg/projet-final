   A microbiological  | culture | , or microbial culture, is a method of
   predetermined culture medium under controlled laboratory conditions.
   Microbial cultures are foundational and basic diagnostic methods used
   The term culture can also refer to the microorganisms being grown.
   Microbial cultures are used to determine the type of organism, its
   predetermined medium. For example, a throat culture is taken by
   strep throat.^[1] Furthermore, the term culture is more generally used
   It is often essential to isolate a pure culture of microorganisms. A
   pure (or axenic) culture is a population of cells or multicellular
